 A12_petition_the_emperor_title:0 "Petition the Emperor"
 A12_petition_the_emperor_desc:0 "Beepeck is the electorate representing the halflings of the empire. However, there are imperial halfling lands across our border in Orston. Orston is a de jure part of Exwes, and has been since before the Lilac Wars, but our right to represent the halflings of the empire should give us claims to this land. We can petition the emperor to cede these lands to us. Improving their opinion, and sending a bribe or maybe even allying the emperor will make them more likely to support us."
 A12_halfling_elector_title:0 "The Halfling Electorate"
 A12_halfling_elector_desc:0 "The emperor may not have directly given the county of Orston to us, but we must still seek to take it anyway, and liberate the imperial halflings there."
 A12_alliance_of_opportunity_title:0 "Alliance of Opportunity"
 A12_alliance_of_opportunity_desc:0 "Gawed and Lorent have been fighting over the Small Country for hundreds of years now. After the Viswall rebellion in 1423, they entered a bit of an agreement for a while to split the Small Country in half. However neither side is content with leaving their rival with half the Small Country. Allying one of these two kingdoms will give us the best opportunity to take Small Country land away from the other. Even if they want it for themselves, they'd definitely be happy with our help getting it away from their rival, even if we keep it for ourselves."
 A12_liberate_small_country_title:0 "Liberate the Small Country"
 A12_liberate_small_country_desc:0 "The Small Country has been under control of foreign human kingdoms for too long. We are the only powerful independent halfling country, so as the representative of halflings in the empire, we shall liberate the halflings and represent them as one Small Country."
 A12_heavy_ships_title:0 "Heavy Ships"
 A12_heavy_ships_desc:0 "Halflings are too small to properly operate galleys that many humans in the Dameshead sea use for combat. To combat this we have to use larger ships where halflings are not disadvantaged."
 A12_conquer_uelaire_title:0 "Conquer Uelaire"
 A12_conquer_uelaire_desc:0 "Orston was the most egregious case of unrepresented halflings, but to the north, all through the duchy of Uelaire there is a significant halfling population. There may be a majority Uelairey, but the large presence of halflings is enough to justify a conquest of the land."
 A12_conquer_exwes_title:0 "Conquer Exwes"
 A12_conquer_exwes_desc:0 "Exwes' unrightful halfling county of Orston may be ours, but a notable halfling population was present in the rest of the duchy. We must continue to strive to unite the halflings of the empire. For this just cause, we will make any sacrifice, even the burden of controlling more wealthy land."
 A12_colonial_endralliande_title:0 "Colonize Endralliande"
 A12_colonial_endralliande_desc:0 "Beepeck is somewhat overcrowded, and many halflings would like the opportunity to start a proper farm on their own land. Additionally, the benefits of bringing trade from Aelantir over to Cannor are not lost on us."
 A12_trade_company_region_abroad_title:0 "Expand Overseas"
 A12_trade_company_region_abroad_desc:0 "Also bit of a placeholder for more Sarhal stuff. A basic mission for trade companies, which will be in Sarhal."

 A12_sarhal_placeholder_desc:0 "Sarhal Placeholder"
 A12_light_ships_title:0 "Trade Ships"
 A12_light_ships_desc:0 "The position as top trade power of the Damescrown is a heavily contested one. A fleet of trade ships is the best way to compete for trade control."
 A12_damescrown_trade_title:0 "Damescrown Trade"
 A12_damescrown_trade_desc:0 "Our top priority should be controlling the trade in the Damescrown Sea. Our current fortune is made from it, and future fortunes will also be made from it."
 A12_trade_league_title:0 "Form a Trade League"
 A12_trade_league_desc:0 "A popular practice among the merchant republics in the Damescrown is forming a league of smaller countries of mutual defense and trade cooperation. If we haven't already done so, doing so now is very important."
 A12_anbenncost_trade_title:0 "Anbenncóst Trade"
 A12_anbenncost_trade_desc:0 "A major source of goods entering the Damescrown is ships entering from the south, passing by Anbenncóst. Direct control of this trade won't be possible without conquering too far away, but methods such as trade ships, and expanding our newly formed trade league will give us greater influence on the goods entering the Damesneck."
 A12_viswall_trade_title:0 "Small Country Trade"
 A12_viswall_trade_desc:0 "Beepeck's position as the primary route for traders from the Small Country to reach the Dameshead is very valuable. It is time to take full advantage of this and get a near monopoly on halfling trade in the Dameshead."
 A12_damescrown_trade_war_title:0 "Damescrown Trade War"
 A12_damescrown_trade_war_desc:0 "The trade republic of Damescrown has been our top competitor for trade of the Damescrown Sea. Defeating them in a war for trade dominance will really show our power, and secure our position as top trading power of Cannor."
 A12_damescrown_control_title:0 "Damescrown Control"
 A12_damescrown_control_desc:0 "With our power cemented, our trade links established, and our rivals defeated, now is the time to finally take full control over the Damescrown Sea. The riches, oh the wealth, all the money in the world will be ours!"
 A12_utilize_the_estuary_title:0 "Utilize the Estuary"
 A12_utilize_the_estuary_desc:0 "The Widderoy estuary flowing through the Saltmarshes is key to Beepeck's position as controller of the trade from the Small Country. By constructing markets along the river we will use this to its full advantage."
 A12_honey_bacon_title:0 "Honey Bacon"
 A12_honey_bacon_desc:0 "The halflings of the Strip have been farming pigs to supply Beepeck with food for ages now, and the Saltmarshes have always been valuable for the preservation of food. Some methods of preservation have a value beyond just lasting longer though. Salt-curing strips of pork creates a delicious food. Greater production from the Strip allows more to be brought to Beepeck, and for experiments in new tastes. Honey glazed bacon will be a brand new delicacy, attracting traders to Beepeck over other ports for a chance to try it."
 A12_the_honeycomb_title:0 "The Honeycomb"
 A12_the_honeycomb_desc:0 "The Honeycomb is the name of the Beepeck City Treasury. Keeping a backup supply of gold is valuable in case of emergency, and can help mitigate inflation."
 A12_house_stacking_title:0 "House Stacking"
 A12_house_stacking_desc:0 "Halfling house stacking is a famous architecture technique created in Viswall after the Viswall Rebellion. The partition of the city into two halves, and defined borders eliminated the ability for the city to grow further outwards. So instead they grew their city upwards. It's not literally full houses stacked on top of each other, but rather multi-floor buildings with different houses on each floor. Beepeck's peninsula is getting crowded, so introducing this technique will allow for easier growth."
 A12_largest_small_city_title:0 "The Largest Small City"
 A12_largest_small_city_desc:0 "Beepeck has held the nickname of Largest Small City for a while now, but in truth, a united Viswall would be significantly bigger. Truly surpassing Viswall as the Biggest Small City in every respect will greatly increase our power and reach."
 A12_settle_newacre_title:0 "Settle Newacre"
 A12_settle_newacre_desc:0 "Newacre is a sparsely populated part of the duchy of Uelaire with a notable halfling population. It's also good farmland that many more halflings would love to settle on. Simply encouraging more halflings to move in will tip the scale from a Uelairey majority to a halfling majority."
 A12_exwes_mead_title:0 "Mead Brewery"
 A12_exwes_mead_desc:0 "While it was always a possibility, the honey produced from Beepeck has never been used for large scale mead production. This is a missed business opportunity, with the nearest source of mead being all the way in Gerudia. Making it difficult, and therefore expensive to get mead in the Damescrown. With newly available space for our halflings to set up honey farms and mead breweries, we can properly take advantage of this business opportunity."
 A12_maintain_elector_status_title:0 "Maintain Elector Status"
 A12_maintain_elector_status_desc:0 "As one of the electors of Anbennar, it is in our best interest to keep the elector status. Through whatever difficult challenge arrives, we must keep our title."
 refuse_our_right_as_elector:0 "refused our right as elector"
 enforced_our_right_as_elector:0 "enforced our right as elector"
 alliance_of_opportunity_tooltip:0 "Allying Gawed will allow us to claim two nearby states of Lorentish Small Country. Allying Lorent will allow us to claim two nearby states of Gawedi Small Country."
