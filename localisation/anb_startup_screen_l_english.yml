 string_start_gawed:0 "§g"To deny a man your table and hearth is as good as killing him. To steal his little bit of land will end his family. We've never forgotten how to be humane to one another — how to be human. Maybe they have."\n-Welyam III Gerwick, on the news of the end of the Lilac Wars.§!\n\n§O‚®¢°§!\nFor a thousand years, there has always been a Gawed - the proud talon in the eye of the powers to its south and east, the threat they could never ignore nor destroy. Formed by the men of the rough, windswept plains, steaming moors, and close, threatening forests of the north, Gawed has waxed and waned over the years but never been truly conquered.\n\nIt has its origins in the §YDragonwake§!, when the city of §YVertesk§! was toppled by §YAlenic§! plainsmen. As the Dragonwake worsened, they moved south through the §YSmall Country§! into the devastated countryside of §YLecencor§!, settling and taking it for their own until driven back north by the unifier-king §YLorenan the Great§!, founder of §YLorent§!, igniting a rivalry that burns to this day.\n\nThe §YCastans'§! rotting empire could not subdue them; despite the §YSorcerer-King Nichmer§! forcing their southern lands under his puppet-state in Vertesk, the moors and hills remained a front of resistance, and when Castanor crumbled, Gawed rose once more. The §YWhite Pestilence§! avoided its cold realms and allowed it to wrest most of the Small Country from a weakened Lorent, setting flame to the smoldering rivalry, before the influence of §YIoriel Redrose§! choked the §YHouse of Gawe§! and sparked the §YDecade of Masks§!, and the civil war that came with it. Since then, Gawed has been ever suspicious of the elves and their vast influence in the southlands.\n\n§O¢þŒ¾ ª²ª¾§!\nWhile most of Cannor has burned in the §YLilac Wars§!, the Kingdom of Gawed was stabilizing following the removal of the last §YBaldfather§! king, §YToman the Mad§!, and has prospered under the new §YHouse of Gerwick§!. Gawed has long been content to expand its influence through quieter means as it rebuilt from misrule, only briefly moving to crush the §YViswall Rebellion§! alongside its longtime rival in Lorent.\n\nThe §YGreentide§! and the end of the Lilac Wars, however, have roused the lords of the north to attention. Were it not for §YCorin§!'s victory in Escann, Gawed might well have been caught sleeping, and the fear of complacency puts dread in every northman's soul.\n\nWith the powers to their east destroyed and those in Anbennar to the south exhausted from the Lilac Wars, they may never have such an opportunity again. Gawed's attention again turns outward; to the city-states along the coast of the §YGiant's Grave§! to the north, to the long-ruined lands of the gnomes and kobolds to their west, and above all, to Anbennar and Lorent in the south. The old empires of men and elves have driven themselves to exhaustion, and thoroughly wasted their day in the sun. It is time for the Eagle of the North to rise!"

The whole of Cannor knows you, and cannot help but admire you, for in your heart beats adventure and in your mind the call to do right burns like a torch! The evil quail, and the downtrodden rejoice, when they see the Red Wyvern fly over the field, for there in fine pantaloons and even finer mustaches march the men of Verne, ever striving for something better!\n\nThe Duchy of Verne was born the Kingdom of Verne, founded by the great §YArmoc Vernid§!, first of the §Ywyvern-riders§!. Astride these two-legged winged beasts, the Vernmen would forge a prosperous land in the south of what would be one day known as §YAnbennar§!, nestled between the §YKhenak Mountains§!, the §YDamesneck Strait§!, and the great §YDivenhal Sea§!. They would rise in fame and renown through their first five centuries, known across Cannor as bold and brave sorts eager for heroics, dramatics, and above all else, adventure. However, the Kingdom would decline as it was "eclipsed by the Moon", the arrival of the §YElves§! and the §YWars of Rule§! forging the §YEmpire of Anbennar§! which reduced Verne to a Duchy. Worse yet, the beloved wyverns of Verne declined and, generations ago, vanished entirely.\n\n§O¢þŒ¾ ª²ª¾§!\nEver loyal, the Vernmen fought for the §YMoon Party§! in the §YLilac Wars§!, quelling the §YLion Armada§! of §YBusilar§! and holding the southern flank for their brothers-in-arms. Alas, it was not enough to save §YDameria§!, and the victorious Rose left her shattered and the empire in the hands of §YWex§!. Yet Verne's greatest glory has been in fighting the §YGreentide§!, vanquished at last. With these wars lost and won, a new chapter in Verne's history begins — §YDuke Armoc IV§! looks to new challenges and horizons for his crowded, ambitious people.\n\nTo the north, the scattered Vernman city-states call for the restoration of what once was, and §YIstralore§! seems to now see a once-friend as a new rival. Across the straits to the west sits a much older rivalry, §YPearlsedge§!, the bald-headed, Reaver-spawn, mariners. To the east Busilar looks avariciously at friendly, island-bound Eborthíl. But between them sit the Hill Gnolls, in the mountains that once were home to wyverns, and across the Divenhal lays Verne's most immediate threat — the slaver-corsairs of §YViakkoc§!, who ravage peaceful settlements and drag off their people for a life in chains!\n\nAnd if adventure beckons from beyond, from the unknown? Well, such a thing is exactly what Vernmen live for!\n\nA new era begins for the land of the Wyvern. Though there may be darkness in the world, it matters little — against the darkness, the light shines ever brighter! To see what lies beyond, to face what is wrong in the world and set it right — these are the duty of the Bold Men of Verne!"

So after §YUrion Starsworn§! gave his life for her, she knew she had to think about the future. So, after the battle, she began to return the affections of a human knight named Sideric, and the two were soon wed.

The Duke of Istralore §YAucan I§! supported him in this, volunteering to take up the mantle of his ancestor Istralara and lead the Empire's armies, earning the title of §YMarshal of the Empire§!. During the §YWars of Rule§!, Istralore stood by their Damerian lords and helped elevate the nobility to rule over the Empire rather than the mages.

It shrieks across the flatlands and over the gray, stormy sea. The men of Dalr fear the wind for its chill, its ferocity, and its Gerudian storms. The men of Cannor fear the North Wind for a very different reason - it brings the men of Dalr.\n\nThe kingdoms of the north have long been fractious and broken, but their mastery of the sea and hard-bitten tenacity have made them a threat beyond their numbers and size for centuries. In the §YEra of Black Ice§!, they terrorized the Cannorian coast, and even took over the great Empire of §YCastanor§!. Greatest among these is Bjarnrík, the Bear of the North, which has always styled itself as the greatest and most forward-thinking of the kingdoms of Dalr. They have reason to think so. From the very beginning, Bjarnrík has learned much from its southern neighbors, when the warrior-queen §YBera§! founded the country on the model of the southern feudal nations -- and with wealth taken from those southerners. Backed by the §YSkalds§!, the great religious leaders of the north, Bjarnrík rose in power for three centuries, before the people of §YSerpentshead§! landed a stunning reversal on them at Fuglborg, triggering the §YWar of the Bears§! in 1200 as the jarls fought each other for control of the north.\n\n§O¢þŒ¾ ª²ª¾§!\nWhat emerged victorious was Bjarnrík, of course, but her situation is delicate if promising. The Jarls of §YSidaett§! and §YRevrhavn§! flaunt their liberties in defiance of the crown, with Revrhavn in particular continuing to reave the southlands to the Konungr's increasing ire. To her north, the §YFrost Trolls§! threaten as they have since before there was a Bjarnrík, enslaving captives in their mountain mines. To the east, the fractured Olavish states squabble and skirmish, even as a dangerous new power rises to their east, where the §YGray Orcs§! have crushed the eastern Reach and seem poised to make something entirely new. Across the Frozen Pass to the south sit the city-states of the Giant's Grave: §YBayvic§!, §YAdshaw§!, §YCelmaldor§!, and the hated §YSerpentgard§!. Beyond them lies the vast northern eagle of §YGawed§!, which they cannot but see as a rival and a threat. But beyond all this - beyond the ruins of the Dragon's Coast - lies the remains of the Era of Black Ice. §YReveria§!, §YDeranne§!, §YPearlsedge§! - coastal states far from Dalr, but all of which bear Dalric blood and have their roots in her legacy.\n\nBjarnrík has much to learn from her lost cousins in the south, but in the end she is not the South - she is not defined by what other people do. She is Bjarnrík, the Bear, and the saga of this age is hers to write and sing. The people of Cannor once knew to fear when the seas froze over and the creak of longships could be heard off their coasts. They have forgotten. They will learn again, and soon."

It is more of a loose set of related deities than a single religion with a strict and formal hierarchy, instead with mostly autonomous temples adhering to a particular patron deity.\n\nBelief is fluid and flexible, with most people paying respect to multiple gods depending on what the worshipper wants or requires - however, most worshippers are expected to have a patron deity that they adhere to above all, usually one that is most relevant to their goal and path in life.\n\nThe Regent Court is structured like a medieval court, with Castellos taking the role of King, and his wife Esmaryal as queen. The rest of the deities are either his children (such as Adean), the offspring of his deceased siblings, or beings either created during the conflicts of aeons past or those that have risen to godhood from mortal upbringings."

They reside on the western coast of Eordand, centered around the ancient rebuilt Precursor city of Arakeprun. The Selpheregi are the most inquisitive and creative of the Eordan, being surrounded by Precursor ruins that inspire them to discover the secrets of the past. They often have a sense of superiority towards the other Eordan because of the flourishing wonders of their homeland. The season of Spring gives them a natural aptitude towards growing plantlife, as well as enabling them to grow flowering bushes on themselves.

They hold an eternal hatred of Winter and the Snecboth who worship it for the cold starving months that arrive each year, resulting in the Hibernal Crusades against the Snecboth as both revenge and a means to end the Winter. They have bright autumnal leaf colored skin in oranges, reds, and yellows that all change to brown in the winter. Their hair is typically black, a stark contrast against their normally vibrant skin.

These migrations have encurred the wrath of the Tuathak, who viewed them as trespassers during their migrations and have blamed teh Snecboth for their hardships caused by Winter. The Snecboth maintain strong interfamiliar and interclan relations, and prefer the calmly discuss matters instead of rashly acting with violence, but do not trust and easily help outsiders who have never helped the Snecboth.

Over the centuries of struggle and isolation from their seasonal cousins, the Peitar have grown bitter and zealous, ready to prove why they are the Chosen Servants of the Fey. The Peitar tribes tend to work together unlike the seasonalists, often allying and working together in war. Due to upholding the balance of seasons, the Peitar are not as strikingly apparent as the rest of the Eordan: they have white to darker than skin, ginger to blond braided hair, commonly wear elaborate warpaint, often have green eyes, and dress in green and brown clothing to blend into the deep forest in both humble linen and fine silk."

While worship of the river arose in multiple places, the formation of the §YYnnic Empire§! in the past allowed a standardization of beliefs and practices across the faithful, with agreed-upon tenets that are periodically reconfirmed through councils.\n\nThe most fundamental tenets come from the ancient kings of Vareynn, and they state:\n§g-The Ynn River is the one true deity while all creatures are merely the spawn of it.\n-The Ynn River carries to the afterlife.§!\n\nIn addition to this, there exists the myth of the §TEnding Flood§!, stating that in antiquity the Ynn River expanded, engulfing the old world in its entirety in a bid to drown out its many sinners. The Ruinborn Elves of today would be the descendants of the survivors of this calamity - but on this issue already, like the many forks of the Ynn, opinions begin to merge and diverge…\n\n§ODebates and Reform§!\nYnn River Worship countries have a £DLC_ed §YReligious Authority§! value. This goes up from accumulating §YIosahar§! vassals, controlling and maintaining §YGreat Ynnic Dams§!, building temples and completing missions. You will gain bonuses based on your level of Authority, and you can also use it to start §TTheological Debates§!.\n\nSettling a debate will give a new permanent bonus, and may result in a revolt against your rule. Once all debates are settled, you will convert to §YYnn River Reformed§! while retaining all the bonuses from the previous debates.\n\nIf you lack the £DLC_ed El Dorado DLC, you will be able to start debates from the decision menu, expending Stability and Legitimacy.\n\n§OZodiacs and Stuir Balia§!\nYnn River Worship divides time into four-year cycles known as §TStuir Balia§!, each associated to a £DLC_won §TZodiac Animal§! giving the faithful a different bonus. 1444-1447 is the §YYnnea Pig§! Stuir Balia (§G-10%§! Land Attrition), and it will be followed by the §YFour-Horned Sheep§! Stuir Balia (§G+15%§! Trade Steering).\n\nRulers bear the zodiac of the Stuir Balia they were born in, which grants them the associated bonus and influences their likeliness to develop certain personality traits.\n\n§OFunerary Barges§!\nTrue to the second tenet, when a ruler dies you are expected to §Tbuild a funerary barge§!. The barge will set out from your capital and slowly travel downstream towards §YAdbrabohvi§! and the §YDivine Waterfall§! §g(traditionally considered the end of the world)§!. Along its travel, a barge may need to pass any of the four §TGreat Ynnic Dams§!: the owner of the dam can decide to graciously §Ylet it through§!, §Ydemand a toll§! for its passage, or, in case of harsh hostility, §Ystop the barge§! and sink it, forcing its occupant to continue their voyage as a floating corpse.\n\nThis situation puts rulers in the §YSarda§! region at an advantage, as they need to go through the least amount of dams before reaching the afterlife, while conversely owning the dams most elves pass through. However, §Tthe longer the travel, the greater the completion reward§!: a barge travelling from §YStenurynn§! to §YAdbrabohvi§! is much less impressive than one coming all the way from §YVareynn§!.

It is centered around the Domandrod, an ancient and forbidden forest populated by the Fey, and around this axle the Eordan build civilizations like spokes on a wheel. The Druidic magic taught to the Eordan after the Day of the Ashen Skies broke the Eordan into five cultures: the Selpheregi who venerate Spring, the Caamas who venerate Summer, the Tuathak who venerate Autumn, the Snecboth who venerate Winter, and the Peitar who strive to maintain balance and heed the orders of their Fey masters.\n\nEordand is soaked in Druidic magical power from the Feyrealm's shadow over the Domandrod. The Eordan primarily dwell around the Domandrod, having left the custody of the Fey long ago, apart from the few chosen Gladewardens. Eordand is surrounded by seas in all directions except for a land connection in the southeast to the desolate Egasach desert, and to the east connected to the Ekyunimoy mountains. Of note are the Sarmadfar Sea alongside the Elarbarc gulf, the Glorelthir coastline, the Randrunnse gulf, and the Broken Sea to the far north studded with icebergs.\n\nThe Domandrod is a vast forest wilderness teeming with wildlife, Fey, and abberations. Within its borders the Feyrealm pokes into the Material Plane, causing fantastical and terrifying landscapes. Surrounding the Domandrod, Eordand is primarily composed of forests and grasslands pierced with rivers, many of which originate from the Domandrod. These surrounding lands may not be half within the Feyrealm, but its magical influence is still strong, moreso than the effect of the Day of Ashen Skies. \n\nIn the western coast along the Glorelthir and Milsgelp coastline the Spring Court grows in eternal bloom, situated where the season of Spring is the strongest. Along the southern coastline of the Sarmadfar the Summer Court basks in the warmth of the sunn and the cool ocean waves, where the Summer is the strongest. In the far north the Winter Court ekes a living in the half-frozen taiga, where Winter strikes every year the strongest. North of the Spring Court, the Autumn Court's homeland along the Fogarabh wages eternal war and preparation against the Winter. \n\nEordand is dominated by the grand cities of Arakeprun and Murdkather, both being built on the bones of Precursor Ruins. Across Eordand Precursor ruins dot the landscape, some piercing the heavens while others are buried beneath the earth. From these ancient structures countless treasures can be found, some mundane while others containing vast knowledge and power."

In time the outskirt regions of §YVeykoda§! to the east and the §YEpednan Expanse§! to the west will be colonized by §YCannorians§! looking for a new life in Aelantir: primarily humans, but also elves, dwarves, halflings, and half-orcs.\n\nThe Ynn River is also the region's main physical obstacle: its strong currents, only partially contained by the §YGreat Ynnic Dams§!, and the monsters lurking below make the crossing of armies a foolhardy endeavor. Only the Great Ynnic Dams provide safe crossing, acting as bridges for armies and priceless strategic points, in addition to their economic and religious value.\n\nOf paramount importantance are the dams of §YVels Bacar§! and §YMocbarja§!, guarding the only route of expansion from the northern regions of §YRzenta§! and §YDolindha§! into the southern lands of the §YSarda§! and viceversa, until new avenues for conquest will be opened up by the creation of §YCannorian§! settlements. The dams of §YAdbrabohvi§! and §YBosancovac§!, meanwhile, are situated on the outskirts of Ynnic Civilization and will become important contacts points with the Cannorian world.\n\nTo the south, the Ynn River Valley ends abruptly at the great §YCliffs of Ruin§!, which many Ynnic Ruinborn Elves believe to be the end of the world, and can be descended only by building §YCliff Passages§! at a few key points.\n\nTo the west and east, the Ynn River Valley is limited by the §YEkyunimoy Mountains§! and the §YDalairey Range§!, from which spring the many tributaries of the Ynn River.\n\nGoing north, the Ynn River Valley is occupied by the fey forests of §YRzenta§! and the unassailable §YForest of the Cursed Ones§!, which open up into the arctic shores of the §YBroken Sea§! where §YIstranar§! or Cannorian §Ycolonists§! may have made their landing.\n\nA gap in the south-west leads to the arid land of §YHaraf§!, which the §YEpednar§! used centuries ago to migrate to the Ynn's western outskirts. Venturing north-west there is a passage into the §YPrecursor Relics§!-rich region of §YEordand§! skirting the §YEkyunimoy Mountains§! and the §YRandrunnse Gulf§!."

Made up of the regions of §YAlecand§!, §YDevand§!, §YChendhya§!, and §YTaychend§!, it is the only civilized and partially settled area of §YSouth Aelantir§!.\n\n§YAlecand§! is one of the largest islands of §YAelantir§!. It is the homeland of both the Kheionai and the Eltibhari. It features 7 great Kheionai cities, from which the Kheionai peoples first emerged. It is a rugged island, with a great mountain, §YThe Meteí§!, at its center.\n\n§YDevand§! is a wild, hilly, and forested place, where the hostile Mteibhar and the nomadic Basobhar make their homes. It is also home to Kheionai colonies on the coast, who hope to settle the interior of §YDevand§!, at the expense of the Basobhar and Mteibhar natives.\n\nThe §YChendhyan§! steppe is a wild and flat stretch of dry grasslands, populated by fierce and aggressive cat riding Chendhyans. While the region remains hopelessly divided by many warring tribes, the 3 great tribes of §YKaeorg§!, §YDurasyar§!, and §YTsidarok§! all share a dream of forming a united Chendhyan state.\n\n§YTaychend§! is a divided and warlike land, filled with warring states. An empire has recently emerged from its northern hills, §YLarankar§!, that hopes to subjugate all of §YTaychend§!."
