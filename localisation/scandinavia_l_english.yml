Eventually, in 1426, their audacity led to an open war between Denmark and the Hansaetic League. To our humiliation, these good-for-nothing merchants won the war in 1435, and enforced liberation from the toll.\nWe should repay our humiliation to the Hansa by either conquering the city of Lübeck, or overtaking their grip over the Lübeck trade node."

Our advisors are divided. On the one hand the usage of a standing army guarentees that we are using professional and loyal soldiers for the defense of our ambitions. On the other hand, we would have to be ready to sacrifice good [Root.GetAdjective] lives for our goals.\nIn the end it is up to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to make the final decision."

Following this, our order established a state in West and East Prussia and we continued our crusade against the Romuva Lithuanians.\nHowever, our presence in Prussia has always been a thorn in the side for the Kingdom of Poland.

 ###LIVONIAN EVENTS###
 flavor_liv.0.t:0 "The Situation of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.0.desc:1 "       The Livonian Order is the successor of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, an order of knights which was annihilated by the Samogitians in 1236. While technically a vassal of the Teutonic Order, the Livonian Order has remained mostly autonomous.\n       However, our order has its fair share of challenges. The Kalmar Union - the very hungry Lions of the North - seek our subjugation. The Lithuanians, backed by their Polish allies, want to annex the Baltic lands, and the Novgorodians to our east consider expanding westwards.\n       But that is not all. In 1435, the bishoprics formed the Livonian Confederacy under the rule of Riga, and started steering precious resources away from us for their own gain.\n       \n       But not all looks grim for us. Times change, and the Livonian Order is at the crossroads of destiny. If we manage to end this confederacy, and manage to push our enemies back then our state can make a choice of which path we shall follow."
 flavor_liv.0.a.tt:1 "The §YLivonian Order§! has a unique mission tree, which is more flexible than other mission trees. After finishing the mission §Y«Strengthen Our Authority»§! we will receive an event, which allows us to replace the Branching Missions with missions from one of the two following paths:\n\n§YLivonian Path§!\nThe Livonian Path is one about secularizing and dissolving the Livonian Order, and reforming into the nation of §YLivonia§!. It will revolve around the development of the §YBaltic§! region and the colonization of the §YNew World§!. It will also allow us to form our own §YGovernment§!, which is forged by our needs and actions.\n\n§YCrusader Path§!\nThe Crusader Path is one about sticking to the purpose of the Order, which is the Chrstianizing of Heathens and Heretics. Your mission tree will lead you on a campaign of conquest and coversion of §YRussia§! and establishing a Catholic Empire in §YEastern Europe§!."
 flavor_liv.1.t:0 "The Future of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.1.desc:0 "       Our Order managed to get the Livonian Confederacy at bay, and secured a future. However, it is apparent that our Order is lacking a proper direction. The dawn of a new era is approaching, and it is now more than ever time to choose how the direction of our state shall look like."

 flavor_liv.4.t:0 "Secularization of the Livonian Order"
 flavor_liv.4.desc:0 "       We are an Order of knights, which had only one goal: the Christianization of the Baltic lands - and we achieved this goal. However, with the Reformation spreading it has become more and more apparent to us that our order has lost its point, and a crusade against fellow Christians is more than absurd according to our advisors.\n       Maybe it is finally time to dissolve the Livonian Order as we know it, and form a proper kingdom - the Kingdom of Livonia."

 flavor_liv.5.t:0 "Prussian-Livonian Alliance"

Naturally, our connection with the Prussians runs deep as we have a common history of fighting back to back against the Baltic pagans and the Polish armies.\n       Our most recent war has shown that while we have grown into separate states, our friendship still prevails to this day."
 flavor_liv.5.a:0 "Our both countries shall stand united against any threat!"
 flavor_liv.6.t:0 "The Creation of a new Government"
 flavor_liv.6.desc:0 "       Our secularization made our country into a monarchy like many others around us. However, as our state is relatively young in comparison, we lack the experiences and traditions our neighbors have made during their lifetime. Even our allies in the Prussian lands have started to introduce systems of efficient administration to their monarchy.\n       It is time that we learn from the experiences of our neighbors, and shape a monarchy which suits our needs."
 flavor_liv.6.a:0 "Les us found a Monarchy worthy to be part of Livonia!"
 flavor_liv.7.t:0 "Livonia declares the end of the Schism"
 flavor_liv.7.desc:0 "       Having the Russian lands fallen into Catholic hands, the knights of Livonia have declared that the Great Schism has ended and that all the Christendom shall follow the leadership of the Papacy. This is however not something that the Pope himself has endorsed, so the validity of the declaration is still under doubt, but these conquests may be an indication that God himself favors Catholicism."
 flavor_liv.7.a:0 "God's intention is clear, the Pope shall lead."
 flavor_liv.7.b:0 "Some mere knights cannot dismiss the Patriarchs."
 flavor_liv.8.t:0 "Decline of the Lübeck Trade Dominance"
 flavor_liv.8.desc:0 "       We gained access to the Lübeck trade through various means and ways, which allowed us to grow in wealth and power. So much so that we finally managed to expand westwards, and acquired a center of trade near Lübeck itself.\n       Due to our progress, the Hansa felt threatened and started limiting our access to their market now."
 flavor_liv.8.a:0 "Quite unfortunate."
 flavor_liv.13.t:0 "Question of Teutonic-Livonian Relations"
 flavor_liv.13.desc:0 "       The Teutonic Order have been our brothers in faith and in arms since the foundation of both our orders.

The Livonian knights have come to us to that effect and established a headquarter in our capital. We should return the favor."
 flavor_liv.14.a:0 "This might be a fruitful connection"
 flavor_liv.15.t:0 "Militarization of the Knights"
 flavor_liv.15.desc:0 "       Our Order started already as a military order, but we have managed to improve the organization and administration behind its knights. As such, our troops are already a proper army instead of just a group of crusader knights."
 flavor_liv.15.a:0 "Our Knights will triumph."
 flavor_liv.16.t:0 "An Army with a Monastery"
 flavor_liv.16.desc:0 "       Our recent military reforms have improved our capabilities quite a lot, but there is still room for improvement. By completely embracing the militarization of our Order we could have an army comparable to any other major country. We would turn from some monasteries with an army to an army with monasteries."
 flavor_liv.16.a:0 "Let's embrace it."
 flavor_liv.16.b:0 "Let's not go overboard."
 flavor_liv.17.t:0 "Second Battle on the Ice"
 flavor_liv.17.desc:0 "       Our defeat at the hands of Prince Alexander Nevsky of Novgorod and their allies from Vladimir in 1242 had been a stain in our military history. Now the tables have turn and we have managed to make them taste defeat instead."

 flavor_liv.20.t:0 "Administrative Chaos in the Office"
 flavor_liv.20.desc:0 "       Although our [Root.GovernmentName] usually has a rather efficient administration, there are just these days where seemingly nothing works.

In other words: we are currently experiencing more chaos than ever expected.\n       In the end, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has to step in to organize the administration."
 flavor_liv.20.a:0 "Concentrate all of our efforts into the administration!"

 flavor_liv.21.desc:1 "       War is a costly matter. It takes resources, men and effort, and victory is not always assured. Although mercenaries were the common and popular way to pursue victories on the battlefield, the states around us started introducing proficient, standing armies which are trained for the heat of battle."

The Engelbrekt Rebellion left a deep desire in the Swedes to gain their independence, but luckily for us, the unionists of Sweden are now siding with [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] to become the next king of Sweden."

Although the Danish forces put an admirable defense, in the end they had no chance against [Root.GetName] and its military.\n       The nobles of the subjects of Denmark are questioning now the current Kalmar Union. The voices for a new King of the Kalmar Union become louder and louder!"
 flavor_got.34.a:0 "The true ruler has returned!"
 flavor_got.37.t:0 "The Lost Claims of Eric Gryf"
 flavor_got.37.desc:0 "       Eric Gryf from Pomerania was once the king of the Kalmar Union from 1412 until he got deposed by the nobles of the Unions in 1435. Ever since then, Eric lived on the Gotland and, more or less, ruled over the island.\n       Due to his past, Eric always had a legitimate claim on the throne of the Kalmar Union. However, his premature death ensures that none of his claims will ever bear fruits... unless the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName] decides to take Eric's claim on the throne for [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]."
 flavor_got.37.a:0 "I shall carry his legacy and claim the Kalmar Union for myself!"

 flavor_got.38.t:0 "The Fate of the Republic of Gotland"
 flavor_got.38.desc:0 "       The island of Gotland sustained itself through fishing and trade for centuries - with the latter becoming a more and more important part of its existence.\n       However, the arrival of former King Eric Gryf changed things up for the Gutnish population. He ruled over the island not as king but as a pirate and ensured that sailors of the Baltic Sea shall never forget his name. Compared to the tedium of normal life, the excitement of privateering seems curiously appealing to many. However, a non-insignificant amount of Gotland's people prefer the safer and more lawful ways of making a living.\n       \n       The Republic of Gotland is at a crossroads, both ways promising great wealth and a future in history books like none others. But which fate shall this island grab for itself?"
 flavor_got.38.a:0 "Our wealth is dependent on our commercial skills. That is our fate."
 flavor_got.38.b:0 "Life is too short to waste it with trading. The fate of a pirate is ours!"
 flavor_got.39.t:0 "A Place in the Sun?"
 flavor_got.39.desc:0 "       Gotland is the island of our origins. A port many of us name their trusted home. But we would be fools if we pretended that it has a better climate than the tropical islands of the Caribbean. Many of our men yearn for relocating our main port to these islands for several reasons.\n       \n       Of course we would have to directly integrate our colony in the Caribbean into our administration too, but this would be a low price to pay for the easier access to the treasure fleets to loot."
 flavor_got.39.a:0 "I have enough of this Scandinavian weather. We are moving to the Caribbean!"
 flavor_got.39.b:0 "Forget that. We cannot abandon our old home of Gotland just like that."

 flavor_got.41.desc:0 "       [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] sails to the port of [341.GetName] with nothing more than a single, pathetically small boat. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] had only one goal: capturing the precious flagship of [341.Owner.GetName], the Hayrettin Barbarossa. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] crewmates called [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] crazy for even attempting this stunt, but [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s determination is absolute.\n       \n       An afternoon, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] arrived at the port, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] boat completely sunken due to hull damage. But that did not bother [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] in the slightest. After a short, unintentional prison visit, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] captured a heavily damaged ship directly in front of the [341.Owner.GetAdjective] authorities. Naturally, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] got pursued by their greatest pride, the Hayrettin Barbarossa, named after their most famous pirate.\n       What the [341.Owner.GetAdjective] sailors did not expect, however, is that [Root.Monarch.GetName] had planned this from the start. So when the [341.Owner.GetAdjective] sailors boarded the damaged ship, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] captured their now empty flagship and sailed into the horizon with it."

Several grand ships docked at the port and dozens of our greedy buccaneers charged into the city of Rome itself. Though the soldiers of [118.Owner.GetName] put an admirable defense, they had made one drastic mistake: they stood in the way between a pirate and his beloved treasure!\n       \n       The siege of [118.GetName] took several days, but in the end the [118.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] had to capitulate. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] then ordered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] men to shoot the doors to the treasury of the Catholic Church open. The coffers of the Curia are open for the pirates of [Root.GetName]!"

 flavor_got.43.t:0 "The Raid of the Venetian Arsenal"
 flavor_got.43.desc:1 "       «Daring! When will we go?» says the young and excited buccaneer. «This is madness, [Root.Monarch.GetName], and you know it» replies the other, much grumpier and older captain. «But it might be worth' shot...», the educated smuggler comments. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] informed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crewmates of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] plan of raiding one of the most defended armories - the Venetian Arsenal. The reactions were... more mixed than [Root.Monarch.GetName] expected. The captains, the buccaneers, the quartermasters and the smugglers all discuss. Back and forth. About risks. About gains...\n       \n       In the end, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] had enough of the debate and convinced everyone of the potential benefit of such raid: while, yes, there was plenty of gold to loot and ships to capture, the main goal was to acquire the Venetian weapon plans for their ships. With them, the [Root.GetAdjective] become unbeatable on the sea; their piratical reign unchallenged. Eventually, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] crewmates agreed on participating in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] plan.\n       \n       In the next morning, one lone, broken [Root.GetAdjective] ship sailed into the Venetian port. Naturally, [112.Owner.GetAdjective] galleys stopped what one would consider to be nothing more than floating wood.\n       After boarding the wreck, one of the [112.GetAdjective] sailors comments how the boat smells like burning wood while another notices the barrels of gunpower littering the floor of the ship...\n       \n       The resulting explosion and clouds completely concealed the [Root.GetAdjective] pirate fleet which then sailed directly into the ports of the Venetian Arsenal..."

 flavor_pol.24.d:0 "       The administration of the Polish crown has been in dire straits for as long as anyone can remember. With the landed nobles' power at peak, passing jurisprudence and signing reforms has been a nightmarish endeavor. With what can be described as unique diplomatic and administrative prowess, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to accumulate enough political capital, as well as favors, to rid our court of these pesky feudal leeches."

Now, to safeguard our people, protect our interests, and maintain our growth and prosperity, we must move along with the times and embrace any and all useful technological advancements, especially in the military field and the conduct of warfare.

Once the great capital of Byzantium, the Turkish armies of the Ottoman Sultanate conquered the city and removed the Byzantine Empire from the face of the Earth.\n       But today, the city is free from the clutches of the Ottomans! While the majority of [Root.GetName] is celebrating our conquest of the city, the [Root.GetAdjective] court is concerned about the government of [151.GetName].

However, power wielded carefully and guided by a steady hand can yield tremendously positive results for our foreign and domestic affairs. The infantile nobles of Lithuania have been pestering us with their refusal to participate in the Sejm Diets and congregations, grinding the entire process to a halt. If they do not comprehend the diplomatic tongue, perhaps they would be more atuned to a show of strength at the expense of their own lands?"

Apparently, the local noble of Poland who was recently crowned a King decided, against the calls of his own advisors, to steer his nation away from its ties to Lithuania, turning its gaze upon the West. As a result, the monarch of Poland has officially petitioned for the entry of his country in the Holy Roman Empire."

 flavor_lit.14.t:0 "Canonization of Kazimierz Jagiellon"
 flavor_lit.14.d:0 "       Originally born in the royal palace at Warsaw, Casimir was brought into adulthood under the tutelage of a Polish priest. His conservative upbringing led him to value his faith and wear it as an emblem upon his chest. His works during his reign, namely the erection of several temples and the betterment of relations with the Holy See led to him being declared a saint, a vibrant figure of Lithuanian piety and religious strength."
 flavor_lit.14.a:0 "Bless our lord!"
 
 
 flavor_lit.15.t:0 "Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu"
 flavor_lit.15.d:0 "       In [GetYear], after a request of the monarch and the upper echelons of the nobility, the Jesuit Academy was created in [272.GetName]. Its primary function was to intermarry religion and science, philosophy and the humanities with theology. The first students enrolled soon after and a grand library was established in the same year, with various prominent figures of Lithuanian politics donating thousands of books and tomes of knowledge."
 flavor_lit.15.a:0 "What a time to be alive!"
 
 flavor_lit.16.t:0 "Restoration of Old Ties"
 flavor_lit.16.d:0 "       The throne of Poland has remained vacant for quite some time, after the tragic passing of the last Polish monarch in the fields of Varna. Having suffered a crushing defeat against the Ottoman forces, the Polish crown shattered, ending a union between three of Europe's largest nations. Now, Polish messengers bring word, asking for our very own Kazimierz to relocate to the Polish capital in order to govern both our nations from his newfound seat of power. However, this would mean giving up on our independence, and to a large extend our autonomy. Our choice in this matter is sure to ripple across the chambers of history."
 flavor_lit.16.a:0 "Our fates are aligned, so be it."
 flavor_lit.16.b:0 "We cannot risk our independence..."
 
 flavor_lit.17.t:0 "The Crimean Steppes"
 flavor_lit.17.d:0 "       Our conquests across the Crimean steppes have yielded great returns, with our domain expanding and newly acquired taxable land. However, this land is foreign to us, its customs and nomadic people remain a mystery. Our advisors at court have come forward with a great many choices as to how to approach this situation. Some suggest we delegate the lands' administration to our Cossack nobles, suggesting their favor and loyalty in exchange for this domain. However, other voices in our council support the idea of a direct governorship or even the inclusion of the nomadic horselords into our administration until their eventual and total assimilation."
 flavor_lit.17.a:0 "Entrust the steppes to the Cossacks."
 flavor_lit.17.b:0 "We will negotiate with the horsemasters directly!"
 flavor_lit.17.c:0 "The land is ours and ours alone!"
 
 #Flavor Events Detached from the Tree# 
 flavor_lit.18.t:0 "Francysk Skaryna and the Wonders of Printing"
 flavor_lit.18.d:0 "       One of the first book printers in the Lithuanian domain, Francysk Skaryna was raised in an affluent environment in Polotsk. He tended to his studies as a student in the university of Krakow from whence he graduated with a degree in arts and later received a doctorate in medicine from the University of Padua in Italy. Years later, after his academic career was complete, he would go on to found several printing houses spanning between Prague and Vilnius. Some of his printing work includes the Psalter and a multilingual translation of the Bible."
 flavor_lit.18.a:0 "And thus we shall become acquainted with the spread of wisdom and science."
 
 flavor_lit.19.t:0 "Khmelnytsky Uprising"
 flavor_lit.19.d:0 "       The most deprived elements in our court, the Cossacks that make up the backbone of our mobile arms, have sent for an ultimatum to the highest authority of the lands. Recent developments in court affairs have left their Hetmans very displeased and they now dare to demand their independence. Their aspirations for independence feed into their unrealistic dream that led to the creation of a Cossack Hetmanate in Ruthenia. If their demands are not met, they threaten the commitment of atrocities and looting all across our countryside."
 flavor_lit.19.a:0 "Give them the autonomy they yearn for."
 flavor_lit.19.b:0 "Fetch my whip!"
 flavor_lit.19.c:0 "The steppes are calling!"

 hsa_peace_vordingborg_desc:0 "In 1435 the King of Denmark was forced to give away the monopoly of his markets to German merchants from Lubeck. It would be wise to reaffirm the terms of that treaty however we see fit."

 hsa_organize_hanseatic_diets_desc:0 "The Hanseatic League, at the height of its power, had hundreds of merchants, guilds and members across Germany and the Baltic, reaching as far as Novgorod and London.

 hsa_develop_mineral_trade_desc:0 "Europe has been struck by the Bullion Famine.

What used to be populated by ill-equipped levied armies made up mostly by peasants and poorly-trained men has now given way to properly trained armed forces and standing armies.

 hsa_pen_sword_title:0 "Pen & Sword"

 flavor_hsa.5.d:0 "       In the 13th century, Novgorod, while not a member of the Hanseatic League, was the easternmost kontor, or entrepot, of the league, being the source of enormous quantities of luxury (sable, ermine, fox, marmot) and non-luxury furs (squirrel pelts). Recent developments in the diplomatic and geographical front have resulted in our merchants regaining their long-lost offices in Veliky Novgorod!"

 flavor_hsa.6.t:0 "The Lubeck Herring Market"
 flavor_hsa.6.d:0 "       The basis for the market's popularity was the rich herring fishing around the Falsterbo Peninsula. Legend tells that the herring fishery off the Scanian coast was so rich, that one could scoop up the fish with one's hands. After a visit to the region in 1364, the French crusader Philippe de Mézières wrote: «Two months a year, that is in September and October, the herring travel from one sea to the other through the Sound, by order of God, in such large numbers that it is a great wonder, and so many pass through the sound in these months, that at several places one can cut them with a dagger.» \n       \n       Embarking on the market as a competitor to Skane would probably prove to be very profitable. However, despite the abundance of marine life in the pass, many advisors in our court suggest we best stay loyal to our main export, Lubeckian naval supplies."

 flavor_hsa.7.d:0 "       The city of Bergen was founded around 1070 within the boundaries of Tyskebryggen. Around 1350 a Kontor of the Hanseatic League was established there, and Tyskebryggen became the centre of the Hanseatic commercial activities in Norway. Since then, the League lost its touch and the offices were granted to other local and foreign merchants. \n       \n       Around [GetYear], an office of the Hanseatic League was established in Bryggen. As the town developed into an important trading centre, the wharfs were improved and the buildings of Bryggen were gradually taken over by the Hanseatic merchants. The warehouses were used to store goods, particularly stockfish from northern Norway, and cereal from Europe."

 flavor_hsa.8.t:0 "The Hanseatic Town of Visby"
 flavor_hsa.8.d:0 "       Visby lies on the Island of Gotland, about 100 km east of the mainland in the Baltic Sea. The settlement, dating from the Viking Age, was formed on a shore with a natural harbour, sheltered by steep cliff formations. Gotlandic merchants utilized it as a strategic point in trade within the Baltic Sea. They allied for the protection of their trading posts which developed into a federation or Hansa. By the 12th century Visby had come to dominate this trade, and all the commercial routes of the Baltic were channelled through the town. After the foundation of Lübeck in 1143, German merchants began to expand their sphere of interest into the Baltic Sea and settled in Visby. It became the only trading place on the island with the privilege of trading with German towns and hence the main centre of the Hanseatic League. During the 13th century, Visby changed from a seasonal trading place into an impressive metropolis, enclosed by a strong defensive wall and increasingly divorced from its rural hinterland. The wall imposed new restrictions on the Gotlandic traders creating tensions that led to civil war in 1288. German, Russian and Danish traders built stone warehouses in parallel rows from the harbour and the community expanded with guild houses, churches and residences. In the 14th century, Visby began to lose its leading position in the Hanseatic League due to plague around 1350 and invasion by the Danish army under King Valdemar Atterdag in 1361. Warfare and piracy in the 15th century and changed trading routes bypassing Visby severely affected trade on Gotland and the economy of Visby deteriorated. However, the recent reacquisition of Gotland by the Hanseatic Merchants will surely breathe a gust of fresh air throughout the island's markets and beyond."

 flavor_hsa.9.t:0 "The Danzig Confederation"
 flavor_hsa.9.d:0 "       The Prussian Confederation (German: Preussischer Bund, Polish: Zwiazek Pruski) was an organization formed on 21 February 1440 at Marienwerder by a group of 53 nobles and clergy and 19 cities in Prussia, to oppose the arbitrariness of the Teutonic Knights. It was based on the basis of an earlier similar organization, the Lizard Union established in 1397 by Chełmno Land nobles. \n       \n       In 1454, the leader of the Confederation, Johannes von Baysen (Jan Bazynski), formally asked King Casimir IV Jagiellon, to incorporate Prussia into the Kingdom of Poland as a fief. This marked the beginning of the Thirteen Years' War between the Order's State and Poland, with the Prussian cities financing the military costs of the latter. \n       \n       Despite the conflicts between the aforementioned parties, Danzig now lies within our sphere of influence. As a result, the merchants of the City and members of the Confederation have come to our court in Lubeck to barter and ask for access to our prosperous markets."

 flavor_hsa.10.d:0 "       We were once dubbed the “Queen of the Hanseatic League” and as the President, our Mayor of Lübeck guided the destinies of the medieval Hanseatic League, which was never officially founded nor dissolved. Our League houses merchants from all over Europe and they meet annually to make decisions as 43 of the 67 Hanseatic Days (Hansetage) took place in Lübeck, which was positioned geographically favorable. This resulted in us taking the leading role in the Hanseatic League. The hub of power was the Town Hall erected in [GetYear] which serves as the central assembly and deliberation chamber for matters of the League. It is one of the most famous Gothic brickwork structures. With its impressive facade, it resembles a fairytale castle. The shape of the building has been defined over three centuries: from 1226 to even today, a succession of new elements were added, and there were conversions and extensions such as the sandstone arcade, the raising of the striking facade with its distinctive circular holes for improved wind resistance as well as the bay window and impressive grand staircase."

 flavor_hsa.11.d:0 "       Not many know that the world-famed Holsten Gate (Holstentor) is not a single gate. It is in fact a series of fortifications added over time to further protect the inhabitants and their riches inside. In particular, the Holstentor is split into 3 layers: the Inner, Middle and Outer Gates. Each was built as a response to the advances of gunpowder and siege equipment, the latest addition of fortifications will surely be adequate and proven to be a sound investment for the safeguard of our wealth. \n       \n       The Burgtor is the oldest of the four former gates of the medieval city fortifications of Lübeck. At the end of the Große Burgstraße, located at the northern end of the historic old town of Lübeck, you will find the castle gate, which was built in the late Gothic style. In addition to the more famous Holsten Gate, the Burgtor is the second largest city gate of the Lübeck city fortifications. The Lübeck Castle Gate takes its name from the old Lübeck Castle high above the Trave, which was converted into a castle monastery in 1227."

 flavor_hsa.12.t:0 "Theory of Mercantilism"
 flavor_hsa.12.d:0 "       Mercantilism is an economic theory that advocates government regulation of international trade to generate wealth and strengthen national power. Merchants and the government work together to reduce the trade deficit and create a surplus. Mercantilism, a form of economic nationalism, funds corporate, military, and national growth. It advocates trade policies that protect domestic industries. In mercantilism, the government strengthens the private owners of the factors of production. \n       \n       These four factors of production are entrepreneurship, capital goods, natural resources and labor. Mercantilism establishes monopolies, grants tax free status, and grants pensions to favoured industries. It imposes tariffs on imports. It also prohibits the emigration of skilled labor, capital, and tools. It doesn't allow anything that could help foreign companies. In return, businesses funnel the riches from foreign expansion back to their governments. Its taxes pay for increase national growth and political power."

 flavor_hsa.13.t:0 "The Hanseatic Cog"
 flavor_hsa.13.d:1 "       The Hansa used a ship called the cog for sea transport. It was a bulky freighter with one mast and a square sail. A helm at the stern and a flat floor made it possible to ship in low water. Unlike the Nordic longboats they were more economical to use. A cog could transport a relatively large amount of cargo with just a small crew, up to 90 tons. It was produced relatively quickly and inexpensively at that time. \n       \n       Larger loads could be transported more cheaply and by a smaller crew than previously. That's what made this type of ship so successful. There were cogs of different sizes, between 15 and 25 m in length, 5-8 m wide and with a moulded depth of 3-5 m. The measurement of the capacity of a cog was called “last”, equivalent to 2 tons. This was the capacity of a carriage drawn by four horses. A small cog of 50 last was able to carry the same load as an endless convoy of 50 waggons pulled by 200 horses. There were also cogs twice as big. With the castle (aft) the surroundings could be observed well. Due to the lack of keel, the cog could also fall to ground during low tide, but it was also restricted to navigate because of that. A cog could only ride with the wind and not cross the wind."

 flavor_hsa.14.d:0 "       The Adler von Lübeck (Eagle of Lübeck), also called Der Große Adler or Lubscher Adler, is a 16th-century warship of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck, Germany. Adler von Lübeck was one of the largest ships in the world at her time, being 78.30 m long overall and displacing 2-3,000 tons. The war galleon was built by Lübeck during the Northern Seven Years' War to escort her convoy of merchant ships in the Baltic and North Sea. \n       \n       Such naval prowess displayed by Adler will certainly be the object of envy in the eyes of our rivals. To safeguard its legitimacy and aura of invincibility would mean that our nation will continue to benefit from its glorious name."

 flavor_hsa.16.d:0 "       The city of Danzig, now lying firmly in our grasp, used to be a hub of trade under the once-mighty Hanseatic League, situated in Lubeck. Since then, the League has fallen from grace due to a plethora of factors and has had its power in the Baltic and beyond challenged. Despite these shortcomings, recent developments around the banks of Germany and the Baltic have led to the League regaining its standing.

Raised in the Giese family and son to Albrecht Giese (another famous and powerful Hanseatic mayor of Danzig and merchant in London) his family had an office in London, which, at the time was the center of European trade. Situated in the Steelyard, the London branch of the Hansa, the Giese family office was part of an enclave where Hanseatic and foreign merchants congregated. \n       \n       There, George studied the mercantile craft and excelled in his studies, graduating one academy after another in flying colours.

 flavor_hsa.25.d:0 "       Hans Holbein (the Younger) was a German painter and printmaker who worked in a Northern Renaissance style, and is considered one of the greatest portraitists of the 16th century. He also produced religious art, satire, and Reformation propaganda, and he made a significant contribution to the history of book design. He is called «the Younger» to distinguish him from his father Hans Holbein the Elder, an accomplished painter of the Late Gothic school. \n       \n       Holbein was born in Augsburg, but he worked mainly in Basel as a young artist. At first, he painted murals and religious works, designed stained glass windows, and printed books. He also painted an occasional portrait, making his international mark with portraits of humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. When the Reformation reached Basel, Holbein worked for reformist clients while continuing to serve traditional religious patrons. His Late Gothic style was enriched by artistic trends in Italy, France, and the Netherlands, as well as by Renaissance humanism. The result was a combined aesthetic uniquely his own. \n       \n       Holbein travelled to England in 1526 in search of work, with a recommendation from Erasmus. He was welcomed into the humanist circle of Thomas More, where he quickly built a high reputation. He returned to Basel for four years, then resumed his career in England in 1532 under the patronage of Anne Boleyn and Thomas Cromwell. By 1535, he was King's Painter to Henry VIII of England. In this role, he produced portraits and festive decorations, as well as designs for jewellery, plate, and other precious objects. His portraits of the royal family and nobles are a record of the court in the years when Henry was asserting his supremacy over the Church of England. \n       Holbein's art was prized from early in his career. French poet and reformer Nicholas Bourbon (the elder) dubbed him «the Apelles of our time,» a typical accolade at the time. Holbein has also been described as a great «one-off» of art history, since he founded no school. Some of his work was lost after his death, but much was collected, and he was recognised among the great portrait masters by the 19th century. Recent exhibitions have also highlighted his versatility. He created designs ranging from intricate jewellery to monumental frescoes. \n       \n       Holbein's art has sometimes been called realist, since he drew and painted with a rare precision. His portraits were renowned in their time for their likeness, and it is through his eyes that many famous figures of his day are pictured today, such as Erasmus and More. He was never content with outward appearance, however; he embedded layers of symbolism, allusion, and paradox in his art, to the lasting fascination of scholars. In the view of art historian Ellis Waterhouse, his portraiture «remains unsurpassed for sureness and economy of statement, penetration into character, and a combined richness and purity of style»."
