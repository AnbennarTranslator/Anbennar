 flavor_newshire.2.t:0 "A Cultivation, Of Sorts"
 flavor_newshire.2.d:0 "Blood is, in the literal sense, life. Osman Kettlebrook, an elderly halfling of one-and-seventy, ponders these words as he works his tobacco pipe. The air is fresh and clean, tainted only by the smoke from his briar. Somewhere beyond his vision, he can hear the muffled laughing of his neighbour's children, just waking up for the day. How nice, he thinks, to be young; to have been born after the wars old halflings like Osman had fought here. How wonderful, to laugh at nothing; to forget the old, rusting ankle-cutters still hanging from the walls of every hurriedly-built home in this corner of Halann. But still, despite his cynicism, he is thankful - for those of his blood continue to walk these lands, free from oppression... for now.\n\nAustin Kettlebrook, a labourer of nine-and-thirty, sits beneath an open window in his home, built directly into the hillside. He carefully slices another sliver of wood from his creation - a toy orc, slowly taking shape, reminiscent of the beasts his father warned him about. The beasts he himself had faced, all in the name of carving out a home in these wild, untamed lands. Of course, the remnants of the Greentide still exist in East Cannor, but even now, sprouts dance across the once-dead land. Truly, the old adage holds firm: Giveth to Halann, and Halann giveth back.\n\nHaree Kettlebrook, a sweet child of barely two-and-ten, sits on the roof of her hill home. The grass is damp and fresh beneath her. Her mother is resting one room over, and her father works on a toy for her in their quaint little kitchen. As for her, she gazes at the horizon as the sun rises overhead. Her parents like to scare her with stories of Escann's dangers... but here, in the peace of morning, she finds it hard to believe them.\n\nIn truth, as the old company gives way for a new nation, only one thing can be certain - this is merely the beginning."
 flavor_newshire.2.a:0 "A new sun dawns over a New Shire!"
 flavor_newshire.3.t:0 "An Unexpected Party"
 flavor_newshire.3.d:0 "'...and so, my dear Conrad, the honey flowed freely in the valley once again, and all the happy halflings never went hungry, spending the rest of their quiet lives with their bellies full and sated.' Haree Kettlebrook, a well-to-do halfling of two-and-fifty, placed the well worn book down, despite the pleas and begs of her grandson.\n\n'One more, please, granny!' He hollered, chin barely peeking out from the thick covers he was wrapped in.\n\n'Perhaps tomorrow, little one. Your grandma has a steaming cup of tea waiting for her before bed; not to mention that growing halflings need all the sleep they can get! How else do you think we get the hair on our feet, hm?' Smiling kindly, she watched as little Conrad Kettlebrook's eyes widened comically, before he leaned over to blow out the candle and burrow himself impossibly deeper into the warm blankets.\n\nIn the kitchen of the little house in the hillside, Haree watched the freshly brewed tea swirl in her cup, frowning thoughtfully. It was ever so expensive to import into Escann, but the small pleasure a mug would bring was unmatched. As she glanced out her window, at the dimming sunlight shining over the half-ploughed fields she'd spent her life caring for, a thought flashed across her mind. The soil wasn't perfect, but she was nothing if not Newfoot through and through. Teasing Halann's bounty from her white-knuckled grip was their specialty.\n\n'My dear,' she called, looking to the doorway where her husband's head appeared, 'do you still keep in touch with those Port Munas fellows? It might be time to try a different crop...'"
 flavor_newshire.3.a:0 "Fresh tea has come to Newshire!"
 flavor_newshire.3.b:0 "We'll just import more instead."
 flavor_newshire.4.t:0 "The Red Days"
 flavor_newshire.4.d:0 "It started with a drop.\n\nWithin days, the Deluge had spread across all of Newshire. As our crops were drowned in blood and gore, the soil withered and died beneath them. Our harvests failed. Our people began to starve, panic, and riot.\n\nOur nation wasn't prepared for this. Was any? Did any need to be as badly as we did, with so many livelihoods dependent on good rains?\n\nPerhaps it was a message. Of course we know of the war over the Court... but maybe we erred somewhere, too.\n\nSome go as far as to whisper even worse... that, maybe, this was how it was supposed to end all along."
 flavor_newshire.4.a:0 "No... There must be a way!"
 flavor_newshire.5.t:0 "Signed And Sealed"
 flavor_newshire.5.d:0 "There was a knock at the door.\n\nA letter, stamped closed with a wax seal, marked with the symbol of Newshire's fledgling transmutation guild. The organisation was small, but had been very helpful with growing bigger, better crops - at least, they were, until all of the crops died.\n\nAs it happens, all of the plants being dead had caused them a rather lot of trouble.\n\n'My name is Layton Kettlebrook,' the page read, 'Grandmaster of the Chloromancy Guild of Newshire. To be direct; we believe that we have a way to end the Red Days.'\n\nThe explanation was concise, and all the Chloromancers requested was the necessary facilities and freedom to continue their research, should it turn dramatic, difficult, or... controversial."
 flavor_newshire.5.a:0 "What do we have to lose?"
 flavor_newshire.6.t:0 "Begin The Transfusion"
 flavor_newshire.6.d:0 "Blood is, in the literal sense, life. Layton Kettlebrook, Grandmaster of the Chloromancy Guild of Newshire, scoffed at this assertion,as the fields shifted from green to rust-red. He commanded his fellow Chloromancers to pay close attention to the contradiction at hand.\n\nWhy does life end itself? Can only one form exist at a time? Can one not bolster the other?\n\nDays passed. Weeks. Months. The Deluge continued to fall. The riots continued to spread.\n\nAnd then, without warning, news arrived, alongside a vial of a deep-red liquid and a sunflower growing in crimson soil."
 flavor_newshire.6.a:0 "A breakthrough!"
 flavor_newshire.7.t:0 "Don't You Worry"
 flavor_newshire.7.d:0 "As quickly as they could, the Chloromancers put their experiments into practice. Halflings from across the realm were organised to spread this solution as far as possible. Newshire was united, the riots stopping as the people found hope once more.\n\nThe process was hard, and long, and resource intensive, but for the first time in years, shoots of grain could be seen sprouting from beneath the earth.\n\nFor now, the Chloromancers are focussed on their work, refining their serum and preparing more every day. They'll likely expect a reward."
 flavor_newshire.7.a:0 "We have been saved! Whatever they wish for, we ought to provide."
 flavor_newshire.8.t:0 "A Mere Bad Dream"
 flavor_newshire.8.d:0 "The downpour has ended. Peace once again reigns across Newshire, as our people are fed, sated, and contented. As quickly as they began, the riots and chaos of the Deluge seem to have been forgotten; everybody seems keen to put the rotten business behind them.\n\nExcept, of course, for the Chloromancers.\n\nThough their experiments have grown rather... outlandish, they seem happy to continue them on their own lands for now. Across the nation, they are heralded as heroes, cheered into every village they enter. Their potions and magics appear ever more potent, and our crop yields have never been this high.\n\nOne wonders how far they plan to go to unearth Halann's bounty."
 flavor_newshire.8.a:0 "Finally, it's over..."
 flavor_newshire.9.t:0 "Really Rather Rude"
 flavor_newshire.9.d:0 "Margaery Kettlebrook's sister, Edora, was married to Tommen Humbleleaf's second cousin, Arkin. It was at a luncheon between the two families that Margaery finally worked up the courage to proposition Tommen.\n\nShe leaned forward in her chair, about thirty degrees (ten beyond what would otherwise be appropriate), flipped her hair over her left shoulder, and flickered her eyes towards Tommen's half-eaten scone, fluttering her eyes gently as she reached for a slice of cake. She then dug her fork into the corner of her dessert furthest from her, lifting it to her mouth and beginning to chew in approximately three seconds. To Tommen (and just about every other halfling at the table) her request was obvious - she wished to begin a romantic relationship, with the possibility of a heated sexual fling on the side, and with the endeavour potentially ending in marriage.\n\nMargaery Kettlebrook made some rather scandalous actions that day. The detail of each was crucial, and positively filthy in meaning... but nothing could possibly match the audacity of Tommen Humbleleaf's response.\n\nHe tapped his teaspoon on the edge of his dinner plate, scratched his left elbow with his right hand, sniffed once, and gulped his tea loudly until only a sixth of the drink was remaining.\n\nTommen's aunt Linlan was so shocked that she fainted. Margaery's brother Marlin looked like he was about to throw himself across the tablecloth to wring poor Tommen's neck. Because Tommen Humbleleaf had just admitted to an infatuation with Margaery that had lasted many years, and a desire to begin the courtship that instant, and (extremely inappropriately - there were children present!) an incredible fascination for the delicate curve of Margaery's soles and perfectly proportioned ears.\n\nConversation continued in the normal, spoken ways, if through gritted teeth, but a great many tellings off and arguments ensued silently. For surely, one could not truly call themselves a Newfoot Halfling if they couldn't notice such changes in body language, or divide their attention between their words, their unspoken conversations, and the expected eavesdropping on just about everybody else in the room."

Despite the name, there was more than just pies on offer - pastries of all kinds, freshly made cakes, bread still warmed from the fire... Truly, a wondrous celebration of the halfling appetite.\n\nIn an interesting combination of circumstances, our people have opted to hold a similar celebration at Dustinwall, on the same date the Stewards planned to announce their new organisational structure. If we were to schedule a vote immediately following the Sampling, we'd likely get enough support to secure a legitimate election!"

 flavor_newshire.13.d:0 "Alder Kettlebrook, a middle-aged halfling of thirty-and-three, was hardly anything special. He rose every morning at the crack of dawn, padding his way to his kitchen to make breakfast for his family. He watered his plants, smoked his pipe, saw his partner to work, and soaked up the morning sun before second breakfast. Some days he would read, either on his little bench by his door or, if it was raining, in his armchair by his favourite window. Occasionally, he would try his hand at authorship, although he knew he would never find the same success as great-grandfather Conrad. Rarely, he'd visit one of his brothers.\n\nThe only remarkable thing about Alder Kettlebrook was his ability to make the perfect pumpkin pie.\n\nIt defied all logic. With just a heap of fresh flour, a sliced gourd, and a few other ingredients he kept to hand, he could create a desert beyond all comprehension. He would get visitors - perhaps three a month - seeking him out for a slice, such was the quality of the dish. And at the Dustinwall Pie Festival (or, as it came to be known, the First Free Fair), the crowd flocked to his table, sniffing out his pastries and devouring them in a matter of minutes.\n\nIt just so happened that, at the First Free Fair, little Belladonna Underhill made a mistake. You see, she was supposed to bring the box of votes for the election to the Stewards, and the box for the Sampling to the judges, but she was awfully distracted by the colours and crowds that she may have... mixed them up.\n\nAlder Kettlebrook was not a Steward. It was rather surprising, then, that Alder Kettlebrook became the First Steward."

 flavor_newshire.16.d:0 "There is a knock at the door.\n\nCora Kettlebrook, a promising young mage, the progeny of Layton Kettlebrook himself, sweeps into the office, escorted by several of her students. All bear the Chloromancer's mark; Cora's adorned with the symbols of the Guildmaster. She smiles tightly - a thorn, hidden amongst a bushel of roses.\n\n'[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName],' she begins, lowering herself into the chair opposite, 'I come with a business opportunity - one which would greatly benefit our darling Shire.'\n\nHer suggestion is simple - an enshrined position in government, protected from the stifling oversight of the Magisterium, in exchange for the continued support of the Chloromancer's Guild. It is not phrased as a suggestion.\n\nEven now, years after the Deluge, the heroism of the Guild is remembered. Their magic is potent, and many a farmer has made her fortune using their elixirs and spells. To refuse them would, implicitly, cost the Stewards their careers.\n\nCora Kettlebrook leaves the office with a declaration in hand.\n\nThe door does not close behind her."

Even now, with the moon hanging overhead, the streets were filled with people going about their business, making a light hum of activity fill the air around them.\n\nIt was unlike anywhere else in Newshire.\n\nInterestingly, Devin Kettlebrook had never liked the quiet. He always worked best with a little background noise. And the buzz of Castonath was giving him plenty to think about.\n\nHow much blood had Newshire spilt, to reach this point? How many lives had been lost? Was this hegemony worth that price? Would even more need to be done, to achieve greatness for the halfling people?\n\nIt was strange. Even here, above the greatest city in all Halann, Devin felt like he had so much further to climb."

Allegedly.\n\nHere's what is known for sure: one day, the castle in Rohiboos stood tall. There was a strange, unseasonal earthquake overnight, and in the morning the fort had completely disappeared.\n\nHere's what may have happened: If, and this is just an example, a fledgling member of the Chloromancers were to, perhaps, accidentally cast a growth spell through a particularly-intense arcane focus, instead of a flavouring spell, then the target plant could grow rather large. Such a plant (a squash, maybe) would most certainly be strong enough to completely destroy the fort, if it were summoned nearby.\n\nI suppose we'll never know. Awfully strange how rumours fly, isn't it?"

More?\n\nIn the chaos of the Consolidation Wars, nobody even noticed as the barriers between government and mage were fully stripped away - dissolved like sugar in hot water.\n\nAt the Dustinwall Free Fair, there was only one dish presented - a mouthwateringly-delicious pumpkin pie, baked by Devin Kettlebrook, Guildmaster of the Newshire Chloromancers, following a recipe left by some great-great-great-grandfather.\n\nMost didn't even realise his relation.

His proclivities simply wouldn't allow it. And, despite his desperate desire for one, it was alright. He had Micah, and Micah had him.\n\nSomething moved, beneath the soil. Even the mutterings were quiet now.\n\nWhen the Chloromancers offered him a solution, Osman was skeptical, but what did he have to lose? The Verdancy was behind them - the worst that could happen would be the death of his garden, and the potential payoff was simply too high to turn down. If this worked for him and Micah, it could work for Poppy and Adeline (who faced the very same dilemma), or Erel (who simply preferred his own company, but still fervently hoped for a child), or Brandon and Isabella (who had tried so hard, for so long, but seemed stymied at every turn).\n\nFrom underneath the ground, pushed up on a bed of bright green leaves, a squalling halfling baby emerged."
