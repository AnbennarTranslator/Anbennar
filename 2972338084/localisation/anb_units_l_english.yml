The armies of the different states are typically formed out of soldiers who spend most of their time defending these fortifications, only leaving during wartime.

The Lightbearers replaced the Gladewardens as a reaction to the encroachment of Cannorians on Eordand. These formations were less regimented than their earlier counterparts, relying on skirmishing tactics of being able to get behind, and shoot from, cover."

 eordand_28_cold_steel_cuirassiersDESCR:0 "While infantry developments made use of the plentiful precursor relics scattered throughout Eordand, cavalry changes followed a more Cannorian line. Armed with Cold Steel, a more refined version of cold iron, their weapons sliced through the invaders with ease. They began to be used as a quick reaction force, patching up holes in the line until a final glorious charge could be made, ending the battle in one fell swoop."

The reforms of the Second Harimraj, however, brought with them a new class of full-time professional soldiers, the Sashtabara. Taught not only to fight with brute force but also to hone skill, artisanship, and high culture in all things, the Sashtabara were formulated by Hemant Sen, last great Raja of the Dhenijanraj. They were the pride of Rahen, warrior-scholars demonstrating the sophistication and superiority of the Harimari."

While some individual Harimari could tame horses and ride in cavalry formations, they were never sufficiently numerous to field full formations of harimari knights. Elephants, on the other hand, had the temperament and mass necessary to carry multiple harimari into battle, and thus saw widespread use in disruption of enemy formations alongside traditional Charger tactics."

 harimari_23_raheni_dragoonsDESCR:0 "As armed cavalry became more important, Chargers, who could not wield weapons during a sprint, were replaced by horse-riding human auxiliaries.

The smaller elephant-mounted cannons were extremely mobile relative to their non-mounted counterparts and could be easily repositioned to take advantage of emerging weak spots in enemy lines."
 harimari_30_harimraj_legion:0 "Harimraj Legionnaires"
 harimari_30_harimraj_legionDESCR:0 "Though the physical advantages of the Harimari were greatly lessened in importance by the modern battlefield, it was their institutions and culture that continued to make them fierce fighters. The pursuit of glory, both for oneself and for one's unit, was a strong impulse that motivated all of the Harimraj's soldiers, regardless of whether they were Harimari themselves."

 hobgoblin_1_hobgoblin_warband:0 "Hobgoblin Warband"
 hobgoblin_1_hobgoblin_warbandDESCR:0 "Some of the oldest memories of the hobgoblin race are the memories of the warband. These simple but profoundly deadly packs of hobgoblins were not particularly sophisticated, but they still took advantage of the fact that when a hobgoblin tries to kill something, it often dies."
 hobgoblin_1_worg_riders:0 "Warg Riders"
 hobgoblin_1_worg_ridersDESCR:0 "Wargs are powerful and highly intelligent predatory animals that hobgoblins learned to use as mounts. Their intelligence combined with an incredible sense of hearing and smell made warg riders some of the finest pursuit cavalry of the pre-colonial period."
 hobgoblin_5_nosunin_pike_squares:0 "Nosunin Pike Squares"
 hobgoblin_5_nosunin_pike_squaresDESCR:0 "The Nosunin (infantry corps) were the centerpiece of nearly all hobgoblin military operations for the next few centuries, renowned for an unrelenting tenacity that allowed the infantrymen to survive the harsh training required to serve. Though a relatively simple take on the pike square, this tactical advancement would be the catalyst that allowed hobgoblin infantrymen to dominate the battlefield across Rahen."
 hobgoblin_5_structured_warband:0 "Restructured Banners"
 hobgoblin_5_structured_warbandDESCR:0 "After the Great Command’s conquest of the ruin kingdoms hobgoblins began to settle in these new lands. This forced the Great Command to restructure the banner system to reorganize the settled hobgoblins into new banners under the jurisdiction of one of the subsidiary Commands. These newly formed banners were often some of the fiercest fighters as their lands would be the some of the first to be lost were the Great Command to fail."
 hobgoblin_6_reformed_worg_riders:0 "Reformed Warg Riders"
 hobgoblin_6_reformed_worg_ridersDESCR:0 "The continuing military campaigns in Rahen led to the development of complex group maneuvers by packs of warg riders, greatly increasing their battlefield efficacy."
 hobgoblin_9_hobgoblin_arquebusiers:0 "Hobgoblin Arquebusiers"
 hobgoblin_9_hobgoblin_arquebusiersDESCR:0 "Hobgoblins were amongst the first in Rahen to adopt early firearms into their military formations. This change allowed the hobgoblins to train and replace lost soldiers far faster than their opponents, who still relied mostly on bows and crossbows."
 hobgoblin_9_zanyu_slingers:0 "Zanyu Slingers"
 hobgoblin_9_zanyu_slingersDESCR:0 "The orcish and goblin slave states have always supplemented hobgoblin armies in an indirect manner, but as the years passed, closer military cooperation between these residents of the battlefield became possible. Integrating the goblins’ precision and orcs’ brute strength into semi-independent ‘slinger’ regiments allowed the Command a ranged option other than archery, and these units soon became a common sight on the battlefield."
 hobgoblin_10_worg_reiters:0 "Warg Reiters"
 hobgoblin_10_worg_reitersDESCR:0 "Because a rider could rely on their warg companion to act independently, it quickly became apparent that they were well suited for the mounted use of firearms."
 hobgoblin_12_hobgoblin_musketeers:0 "Hobgoblin Musketeers"
 hobgoblin_12_hobgoblin_musketeersDESCR:0 "Due to the success of the arquebus in early campaigns, the Boar Command would develop highly advanced infantry fire drills to ensure synchronised loading and firing. These drill techniques would allow the Great Command to quickly capitalize on the introduction of the musket, creating unyielding walls of fire to shatter all opposition."
 hobgoblin_12_ringshield_infantry:0 "Ringshield Infantry"
 hobgoblin_12_ringshield_infantryDESCR:0 "As the arquebus began to lose popularity in favor of the musket in most militaries, some hobgoblins instead adapted it for modern combat. Better rifling and a shorter barrel allowed for one-handed firing without losing the brutish stopping power the arquebus was known for, enabling infantrymen to carry a small, one-handed shield to assist in close-quarters engagements."
 hobgoblin_15_fire_and_squat:0 "Fire and Squat"
 hobgoblin_15_fire_and_squatDESCR:0 "Perhaps the peak of hobgoblin military ingenuity, the Fire and Squat formation was a unique solution to the constant struggles of coordinating line infantry without risking friendly fire. As the first row of soldiers fire, they swiftly squat and begin reloading their weapons as the row behind them fires immediately over their heads, thus mitigating downtime and allowing for constant volley after volley. Though this tactic would be clumsily adopted even as far as Cannor, humans lacked the natural dexterity and unrelenting drill that allowed hobgoblins to orchestrate these feats near-flawlessly."
 hobgoblin_15_beast_formations:0 "Beast Formations"
 hobgoblin_15_beast_formationsDESCR:0 "As the Great Command’s borders grew, so too did the diversity in its tactics. Adapting to their environments, the subsidiary Commands developed unique specialty formations based on their home regions, combining local concepts with hobgoblin discipline and ingenuity for maximum effect. It soon became a requirement for enemy reconnaissance to determine which region a hobgoblin army was from before battle, lest they be overrun by the ferocity of the Dragon Command, the relentlessness of the Elephant Command, or the sheer terror induced by the Tiger Command."
 hobgoblin_19_hobgoblin_legion:0 "Hobgoblin Kikun"
 hobgoblin_19_hobgoblin_legionDESCR:0 "There was perhaps nothing so frightening to the peoples of Haless as the sight of thousands of hobgoblins acting with the unity and discipline for which they were so well known, a discipline unmatched in Haless. The march of a full kikun could be heard long before they ever reached the battlefield, instilling dread in those unfortunate enough to face them. All of Haless learned to fear the marching sound of boots in perfect synchronicity."
 hobgoblin_19_ninyu_primacy:0 "Ninyu Primacy"
 hobgoblin_19_ninyu_primacyDESCR:0 "The Ninyu Kikun was the combined army composed of only the most distinguished warriors from all Commands. Breaking the long-standing tradition of each marshal commanding exclusively his own soldiers, the Grand Marshal eventually established the Ninyu as an independent branch of the army. Its repeated successes against insurmountable odds soon earned it its place as the vanguard of the Great Command."
 hobgoblin_18_worg_cavalry:0 "Warg Cavalry"
 hobgoblin_18_worg_cavalryDESCR:0 "With the role of pursuit cavalry diminished on the modern battlefield, warg riders evolved their battlefield tactics to revolve around a decisive flanking charge. The monstrous wargs were more intimidating and demoralizing than horses, though they could not be packed as densely in formation."
 hobgoblin_23_hobgoblin_gragoon:0 "Hobgoblin Dragoon"
 hobgoblin_23_hobgoblin_gragoonDESCR:0 "The adaptation of modern horse breeding techniques for use with wargs led to the development of smaller breeds that were well-suited for mounted infantry, while the larger breeds retained their role in breaking formations through a massed charge."
 hobgoblin_23_hobgoblin_line_infantry:0 "Hobgoblin Line"
 hobgoblin_23_hobgoblin_line_infantryDESCR:0 "As traditional melee weapons almost completely vanished from infantry use, prior formations had to be re-examined. This led to the military theorists of the Boar Command creating a staggered line formation that became the hallmark of hobgoblin infantry during the period. This shift to a purely firearm based formation was met with resistance from traditionalists within the Boar Command who favored the glory of melee combat."
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_cuirassier:0 "Warg Cuirassiers"
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_cuirassierDESCR:0 "Paradoxically, as firearms completely took over infantry regiments, they began to decline in use for cavalry. A saber-wielding, warg-riding cuirassier would disrupt infantry lines during reloading, easily cutting through the lightly-armored soldiers of the early industrial period."
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_rifle:0 "Hobgoblin Riflemen"
 hobgoblin_26_hobgoblin_rifleDESCR:0 "Fast, accurate, and astoundingly deadly, hobgoblin rifle regiments sacrificed range for a quicker reload time. Rifled barrels improved precision in the hands of a skilled and well-practiced user, leading to the fearsome reputation of hobgoblin riflemen."
 hobgoblin_30_hobgoblin_drill:0 "Simulation Drill Infantry"
 hobgoblin_30_hobgoblin_drillDESCR:0 "The quest for the perfect drill had long plagued the military theorists of the Great Command. Regardless of how advanced, strict, and strenuous the drills became it was impossible for new recruits to match the skill of veteran soldiers. After many long years of research and testing, the artificers of the Dragon Command had created a solution to this eternal problem, the Warfare Simulator. Through an advanced system of illusions soldiers could be trained and drilled for any conceivable battlefield condition before ever seeing true combat. The simulation drill allowed the Great Command to mass produce fresh veterans."

To match this, an evolution of the Ironmonger began to take shape. Using captured dwarven firearms, or more often poor quality imitations referred to as “pipeguns”, orcish warbands would form firing lines of armoured ironmongers, which would unleash a barrage of shrapnel as they charged the enemy and entered into melee, using their superior speed and strength to rip into the enemy."

These large, serrated axes possess a chain that is affixed to the bottom of the shaft, which is then wrapped around the arm of the wielder. These axes are thrown at short range, lodged into the enemy, then violently ripped out with their chains, leaving bloody, crippling wounds, severed limbs, or decapitated bodies of the enemy. Used en masse by a trained warband, the effect is devastating against an undefended, or unprepared, enemy."

While a far cry from dwarven rifles and rotary guns, these new Pipe “Pistols” were less prone to failure than previous orcish firearms, making them far safer for an orc to use.

Combined with the Bologorash, these grog-drinking berserkers then become a destructive force of nature on the battlefield, crushing all opposition in their path as crippling blows are shrugged off or ignored entirely."

For many traditionalists, the Axeshot Arquebus was the solution to a lack of firepower whilst still retaining the desire for melee combat. The Axeshot Arquebus was, as the name implies, a short-barreled arquebus with a sharp axehead attached either by pins, a tube placed over the barrel, or in some cases forge-welded to the barrel itself. A devastating barrage of gunfire would be fired to weaken the enemy, followed by a sprint to the enemy line and devastating melee."

However, a number of orcish warriors would adopt new tactics in the face of massed volley fires by their shorter foes. Named Earthshatter Formations, orcs would carry a half-dozen grenades as standard issue, using their superior strength to lob them further distances than their enemies could in the tight caverns of the Serpentspine.

When the Jadd brought Verkal Gulan into its light, and later Seghdihr to its knees, the Black Orcs of the Middle Dwarovar took notice as their age-old foes were brought to heel. When the first missionaries arrived, there was tension, and often violence, but from these elves a truth was soon revealed. Learning from the strong is not a weakness. It is a necessity. With our own soldiers humbled so thoroughly, all that remained was the drive to adapt. Adapt our guns, adapt our lines, adapt the heads of dwarves into the ground. The Jaddari missionaries taught us many things, and with this newfound knowledge, Black Orcs have become a semi-modern fighting force."

Longer barrels meant longer range, which ultimately translated to more volleys before melee. Though this departure from tradition left many orcs alienated, the results could simply not be ignored, ultimately reshaping Black Orcish military doctrine into a model similar to that of the Green Orcs of Cannor."

With black and grey coats to help obscure them in the darkness of the caves from their enemies, Roadprowlers have equipped themselves with dwarven-inspired weaponry, such as repeaters or rifled muskets, usually raided from felled foes, but also made in growing quantity and quality by orcish hands."

The regenerative properties of troll flesh are well known, and the troll is kept and “harvested” for flesh, which is then allowed to grow into new trolls to enslave as shock troops, or grafted onto existing enslaved trolls. The culmination of this is a small army of Dire Trolls; trolls that have been mutated and grafted together to create a monstrosity just as likely to eat the Dire Troll beside it as they are to eat the warband’s enemies."

Regardless, these packs can be dominated and gained control of, either by shamans and magical enslavement, or simply beating the animals into shape and a taskmaster establishing themselves as the leader of the pack.

In battle, archers would be massed into one large formation to fire salvos of arrows at their enemies until their quivers were empty.

Her retinue would be named the Skull-Cross Ravagers, named for their skull-motifs painted throughout their equipment (armour, helmets, and even faces). The Ravagers would often be kept in reserve in intense pitched battles, before being sent out as the vanguard of a second wave of gnolls against the exhausted adversary, with spiked clubs in their hands, daggers between their teeth, and rabid hunger in their hearts. The legacy of their military feats would spread amongst the seven seas, ultimately inspiring the iconic skull and crossbones used by pirates of all races."

Such a piercing cacophony often flows through the desert air, filling the ears of both elves and humans with an eerie dread before the tension is broken by flurries of arrows. Following this deadly barrage, the gnolls emerge from the dunes, cackling loudly before attacking the stragglers in melee combat. This encirclement strategy, combined with such a distinct, piercing battlecry, became infamous in the early years of the Age of Unravelling from the hills of Bulwar to the seas of Rahen."

Throughout the zenith years of the Age of Unravelling, gnolls began to implement complex manoeuvres among their units to effectively fight drilled gunpowder armies. Simple strategic goals were issued from pack commanders to their many lieutenants to carry out however they pleased, with success being rewarded and the prospect of promotions and bonus loot and failure punishable by death (often by kin-cannibalism or ritualistic sacrifice). As a result of this vicious meritocracy, only the most competent and loyal lieutenants remained, who proved to be capable at leading smaller warhosts to outflank, outmanoeuvre, and outsmart the Pack’s many enemies at the tactical level."

However, one of its most seeked exports was the Cannorian handgonne, which would proliferate throughout the gnollish population for its thundering noise and ease of manufacturing. Gnolls would modify the handgonnes by shortening and widening the barrel, allowing for multiple shots to be stuffed into the gonne to be fired simultaneously. Due to the successful but monstrous brutality of such firearms, human and elven scribes would spitefully dismiss them in their literature to mask their shame and fear of dying to such crude weapons in the hands of gnolls."

Gnolls would develop a pike-and-shot strategy, arming half of their host with matchlocks and the other half with fire-lances with identical face paints to the musketeers. Generals would lead their armies into the pikewalls, deceived by such a simple misdirection, while the wise would send skirmishers to challenge the pikemen, only for them to be scorched by belching flames from the pikemen at close range before being slaughtered. In reality, the dubious quality of such fire-lances often undermined this novel strategy, as the fire-lances were mocked for frequently spreading burning tar, fat, and sulphur within gnollish formations instead."

In a desperate effort to stem the threat of rebellion, and to adapt to the shifting tides of war, gnolls began to offer worthy slaves freedom in exchange for military service. Pressed into slave battalions, these soldiers would be simply drilled to operate “imported” (scavenged, stolen, salvaged) firearms before being integrated into battle-ready packs for future raids. Poor training, supplies, and leadership from their pack mistresses guaranteed that many of these “soldiers” would be condemned to early graves, never laying eyes upon the freedom promised to them."

However, an increasing proliferation of firearms through raiding and enslaved craftsmen capable of spreading the art to their gnollish masters ensured a modest supply of marginally acceptable firearms. In a bastardization of modern Jaddarin drill, gnolls would form into “boomstick lines” and fire an unholy salvo of shrapnel and fire before charging into the fray of the weakened opponents’ formations. Though effective against inexperienced levies and garrison troops in the borderlands they raided, the gnolls would often shatter their teeth upon any formation of drilled line infantry and retreat into their homeland."

When firearms were introduced into the Salahad, shamans were encouraged to bless guns with demonic rituals, allowing their shots to be demonfire conductors. Throughout the Age of the Witchkings, powerful gnollish leaders would equip their most loyal and zealous gnolls with demonic blunderbusses and bullet-resistant plate armour which resembled the scales of ancient dragons.

Goblinfire, an esoteric compound from the ports of Aqatbar, was introduced to the gnolls during the Age of the Witchkings through trade with the Overclan. This black concoction would be funnelled into canisters before being ignited by a slow-burning match, then ejected through an air-powered hose, producing a constant stream of hellish fire. Although such contraptions were too heavy to be used in pitched battle in the Salahedesi, gnollish lieutenants would use these flamespitters in an exhibit of power, intimidating enemy garrisons and rebel holdouts with the threat of painful and slow immolation."

Iron-cast grenades, blessed by the shamans, became the iconic weapon of the Fleshroast Brigades for their devastating power against any material. Projected with specially-crafted staff slings, these grenades could fly hundreds of feet in the air before exploding under the feet of the enemy, butchering and roasting their flesh alive or above their heads, showering them with shrapnel and demonic fireballs.

One such wretched invention was the volley-gun, a multi barreled flintlock musket which would fire a volley’s worth of shots simultaneously, tearing any unfortunate souls apart at close range.

Admired for their high rate of fire and accurate lethality, gnollish artificers would replicate their design; although these copies would lack the exquisite Dwarven craftsmanship and detail.

By the dawn of the Age of Artificers, gnollish commanders would start issuing sappers with greenflame launchers, heavy flamethrowers that could launch concentrated fireballs at enemy garrisons.

In spite of these flaws, the 2-gauge shotgun would be adopted into gnollish military strategy. Gnollish companies would implement pin-and-flank tactics, wherein skirmishers would pin down enemy units with accurate rifle-fire from advantageous terrain to allow the 2-Gauge shotgun crews to flank deep into enemy lines unchecked, firing canister shots to disembowel the pinned enemy units. The skirmishers would then charge forwards, slaughtering the stragglers in melee combat.

Likewise, gnollish cavalry often consisted of dragoons armed with long-barreled muskets, dressed in the bones of their latest hunts.

 harpy_12_rattling_shriekersDESCR:0 "While the eastern harpies learn to charm foes with their beautiful voice, those in the west continue to refine their voice to create even more terrifying shrieks in battle. In time, they would use specially-made rattling instruments to add a similarly disturbing and painful background noise to their shrieks."
 harpy_15_dual_couriers:0 "Dual Couriers"
 harpy_15_dual_couriersDESCR:0 "As the eastern harpies join the Desert Legion’s crusade against Rahen and Bulwar, they also develop new tactics used in collaboration with human and elven soldiers. Most common is the use of harpies as aerial transports, silently delivering soldiers behind enemy lines or into a city defended by a fortress."
 harpy_15_flying_arquebusiers:0 "Flying Arquebusiers"
 harpy_15_flying_arquebusiersDESCR:0 "Archery has served us well in the past, but the time has come to modernize. The armies of Bulwar have long since employed powder-based weaponry like the arquebus, and the time has come that we do the same. Using verticality to gain an unobstructed line of fire and our enhanced vision for deadly precision, we shall become the gunslingers of the skies."
 harpy_19_aerial_crossfire:0 "Aerial Crossfire"
 harpy_19_aerial_crossfireDESCR:0 "As the humans of Bulwar adapted to high-altitude combat by using large, curved shields, harpies began to switch to several overlapping fields of fire, ensuring the enemy remains in enfilade and cannot defend against all angles of the oncoming storm of projectiles."
 harpy_19_feather_flechettes:0 "Feather Flechettes"
 harpy_19_feather_flechettesDESCR:0 "Though typical firearms are a challenge to fire from high altitudes, specialized dart-like projectiles known as flechettes have begun to surface as a possible alternative. Though they lack the stopping-power of firearms, they also lack the tremendous recoil that has prevented their widespread adoption into the army. Using harpy feathers to keep their aim true, these new flechettes will prove deadly on the battlefield."
 harpy_23_harpylen_sharpshooters:0 "Harpylen Sharpshooters"
 harpy_23_harpylen_sharpshootersDESCR:0 "The implementation of sharpshooters in a modern battlefield requires that two pressing issues be solved: inaccuracy and advantageous positioning. The propagation of flechettes among harpy militaries largely solved the prior issue, and there is no better position than the open sky. Before the enemy can react, hailstorms of flechettes shall rain from the sky from previously unheard of range."
 harpy_23_siadan_stormsingers:0 "Siadan Stormsingers"
 harpy_23_siadan_stormsingersDESCR:0 "Though song has largely fallen out of favor among the western harpies, in Far Bulwar the tactic remains strong in the form of the Stormsingers of the Siadans. Employing a combination of song to daze then shrieks to disgruntle, the Siadan Harpies have perfected the art of vocal warfare, with most enemies swiftly becoming disorganized rabble within minutes of unprotected observation of the harpies’ melodic cacophony."
 harpy_26_aerial_grenadiers:0 "Aerial Grenadiers"
 harpy_26_aerial_grenadiersDESCR:0 "The typical plunger grenades seen throughout Bulwar are largely effective from close range, but are prone to shattering and possess numerous other design flaws. Thankfully, the unique biology of harpies allows us to forgo mechanical complexity in favor of pure concussive force. By weighting one side of the grenade to have a clear center of gravity, the simple motion of falling is enough to prime the plunger, allowing for a swift explosion the moment the grenade hits the ground, with misfire a very rare occurrence."
 harpy_26_needlegunners:0 "Needlegunners"
 harpy_26_needlegunnersDESCR:0 "Recent advancements in breech-loading have brought rise to a breech-loaded variant of standard flechette launchers, dubbed quite simply the Needlegun. Launching flechettes made with harpy feathers instead of iron, Needleguns are far lighter than other contemporary firearms and lack the tremendous recoil that plagued early aerial sharpshooters."
 harpy_30_airland_warfare:0 "Airland Warfare"
 harpy_30_airland_warfareDESCR:0 "As with most things, the full potential of harpy warfare cannot be realized with our soldiers alone. By integrating human auxiliaries to launch frontal assaults as the enemy is peppered with Needlegun fire from above, all forms of defense are invalidated. Trenches will be fired at from above, and canopies will be stormed by ground forces. Any that stand in our way are to be pitied."
 harpy_30_the_gyrojet:0 "The Gyrojet"
 harpy_30_the_gyrojetDESCR:0 "With the continued adaptation of artificery in the military comes innovation. Behold the Gyrojet, a gyro-stabilized rifle that launches miniature self-propelled combustion devices. A weapon with virtually no recoil, perfect for firing at unsuspecting targets from unprecedented distances."

As legendary as the Companions' fame, are the disparate weapons and armour-pieces they wield, so effective, they are rumored by Cannorians to be Precursor Relics.

Before stirrups were adopted, most knights would in fact dismount and fight on foot during prolonged battles, and this role became prominent again during the late Age of Witch-Kings, thanks to the inspiration provided by Malacnar Companions. Dismounted Ynnic Knights or "Nohy Vytrie" were those knights who entered the battle already on foot, and they were most commonly last-born sons or lesser nobility, serving as elite infantry to rally the other troops and provide the mainstay of the Ynnic battle line. Donning full body armour and wielding greatswords, they slowly but surely advanced towards the enemy lines, deflecting enemy bullets from a distance.

Teira battle style is an extension of their lifestyle: small, secretive bands who scrape by while doing their best not to draw attention, but capable, if cornered, to set lethal ambushes against their would-be hunters. Having arrived to the Ynn thanks to a secret pathway through the Forest of the Cursed Ones known only to them, Teira were outfitted with weapons such as crossbows, spears and throwing daggers of a far higher quality than anything they were used to, but even under the service of Ynnic Lords they still continued wearing the same camouflage-painted fur coats their brethren did in Dalaire. This attire favoured their primary task: irregular warfare, skirmishes, ambushes and supply train disruption, providing a response to the frontiermen's own asymmetrical warfare and developing a fame as hunters of men second only to Wendigos. The sight of the Teira’s glowing eyes staring at you from the woods was enough to send common troops into a panic."

Discipline was enforced, and the previous Drozmateer tactic of charging at will into enemy lines was abolished; Gospodh Aranthiv deemed it "Improper of a modern army".

 ynnic_30_longbow_knightsDESCR:0 "To Ynnic Knights, the crossbow was seen as a devious device to fabricate strength, the shortbow was the weapon of lowly woodsmen and the composite bow was for bandits. But the longbow? Ynnic Knights admired the Damerian longbow, which required strength and years of training to use. Imported in the nineteenth century, it quickly became one of their favourite tools when out hunting. At the battle of Velencestor in 1811 400 knights fought in the frontline as heavily-armoured foot archers, and their arrows, glowing blue with magic, rained destruction on the enemy musketeer lines by buzzing through several men or exploding upon landing. The future Empress Morvel was leading these archers, having been the one to perfect those magical arrows during her exile in Veykoda. By her campaign's end, the Vytrie Rongukol — Longbow Knights — had grown into a 1000-strong regiment, and more were commissioned during her reign. Veykodan rune magic was applied to both the bows and armour of the knights, with carvings in elegant patterns that enhanced not only the beauty, but also the performance of their equipment. The longbows, with largest surface area of all types of bow, were optimal for rune magic."

True to their factionalist indole, there were two different Tuathak Foreign Legions of which one served the Dragon Dominion, the other the new Sarda Empire. While those of the Dragon Dominion unleashed the power of Eordand's new deadly magirifles, those under the Sarda Empire were infamous for slowly starving their prisoners to death before throwing their bodies into the river, and in battle they wielded poison-laced copper swords similar to Dracball, the sword of Artorean the Dragonslayer, with an obvious message."

Given a light chainmail and a overhand lance, all Ynnic Squires need to do is keep hold of their horse, and steer the magnificient beast as it does most of the job on its own goring and trampling the enemies to death."

And why invest all your money into heavy plate armour for yourself, when you needed mobility in order to acrobatically jump off anyway? Due to their proximity to the ironhouses of Brelar, Dolindhan knights were the first to be able to afford horse armour consistently, and they often overlayed it with cloth in the colour of their suzerain's emblem. Most famously, the Amethyst Knights of Amacimst flaunted a bright purple barding."

In order to get enough goblins for his war against Birzartanšes and Baharkand, Perzuk, chief of the Marbleheads, promised loot and land for those who would follow him into battle, and thousands of goblins and humans alike took up his offer.

Instead, goblins armed with shortbows along major caravan routes laid in wait for oncoming caravans. They would then emerge and fire dozens of arrows into the caravanners, killing them before they could flee or strike back. Eventually, the Greysheeps would also use these highly experienced and surprisingly accurate warriors for battles, where they would earn their name after a small force of 200 goblins with shortbows held a hilltop for 6 hours against thousands of Gelkar soldiers."

The warriors of the Mountainhuggers are well known for their skill in navigating the mountains of their homelands and are highly agile for goblins. During the wars against the alliance of Re'uyel, Crathanor, and Ovdal Tûngr, roving bands of Mountainhuggers would travel the hills and mountains of Bahar, destroying or pillaging everything in their wake before the Bahari could find them."

At first, the cost limited its use to only the most elite of troops such as the personal guard of the chief of the Landsharks, but goblin blacksmiths soon began producing crude copies in huge numbers, allowing for massed formations armed with guns. Although the guns had a rather high chance to explode in the user's face and lacked all semblance of proper accuracy, they still proved remarkably deadly, especially against the Bulwari and Sun Elves who had not yet embraced gunpowder warfare."

Many of Perzuk's volunteers had already retired by then, and their children lacked the ambition of their forefathers. As such, the Marbleheads had to extend the same offer to their human subjects, and though a large amount took it, they only begrudgingly accepted the idea of fighting alongside goblins, who they consider spawns of the Malevolent Dark. Fights, thievery, and murder were common in mixed units, but mixed units were rather effective in battle as the strengths and weaknesses of the humans and goblins complemented each other and showed the potential for continuing such tactics if morale issues could be fixed."

This orange-colored gemstone, found only in Bulwar and surrounding regions, is prized by the Sun Cults, and for good reason. If left under full sunlight for more than six hours, it would shine in the darkness and repel certain undead creatures. However, artificers and priests in the Overclan found that when charged with magical energy, sunstones could be turned into a kind of grenade that would shine with a power akin to the sun for a few moments upon being thrown, turning everything in close proximity into ashes. All Jadd soldiers in the Overclan were issued a couple of charged sunstone gems, but there were specialized units who were issued with vast quantities of sunstone to rain the power of the sun upon the enemy."

The mixture was placed in steel tanks that would launch the volatile sludge using pressurized air and nozzles. The government of the Overclan immediately hired the rogue tinkerers and gave them the funds to set up a production complex. These flamers, as they were called, were issued to only the bravest of soldiers who were called Flame Sappers and given thick armor to protect them from both their weapon and enemy fire, since they had to advance to very close range to use their flamethrowers."

However, this changed when the Ancardian-trained Bulwari officer Ashur Zamuraš was appointed commander of the army tasked with guarding the frontier with the Harpylen Queendom. He immediately began reorganizing the regiments under his command to have an equal number of goblins and humans, enforcing a high standard of conduct among his men. He also placed a high amount of importance on firing discipline, forcing both human and goblin soldiers, who previously simply fired whenever their guns were loaded, to coordinate their volleys. When his superiors in Aqatbar saw this, they immediately had Zamuraš appointed as Chief of the Army so that he could spread his methods across the Overclan."

Thus the first iteration of the Sunscorch Handcannon was produced. This highly innovative and extraordinarily dangerous weapon fired a kind of goo, named sunplasm due to its similarity in texture to ectoplasm, which could burn through just about anything. Sunplasm is produced by heating air to very high temperatures with a Damestear crystal, but because it could melt most known alloys, this process was required to happen within the handcannon. This meant that if the process failed in any way, it was the user’s life that paid the price."

While nearly all proposals used explosives in some way, one stood out. Proposed by the military engineer Aminkle Picktooth, it consisted of using powerful explosives to artificially create landslides, burying the enemy in tons of rubble and dirt and blocking the passage of reinforcements. This strategy was put to the test during a border skirmish with Ourdians in 1702, where it worked wonderfully, with hundreds of Ourdians buried beneath smoldering rock. Brokenhammer was rewarded richly, and the Landslide Corps was officially established just a few weeks later."

As expected, the inventions that intrigued them the most were Sunplasm and Goblinfire. They meticulously studied these odd weapons, and to the horror of the rest of Bulwar, actually improved them. They combined the flamethrower with Goblinfire and created a terrifyingly powerful flamethrower that shoots Sunplasm by adding magical wards to the nozzle, pipe, and Flame Sapper armor so that it could withstand the heat of a constant stream of sunplasm. They were named False-Suns, after the incredibly destructive power that the weapon released."

Plagued with an internal guerilla war in the west and worker strikes in the capital, all the while still suffering from the consequences of the Voltoj Coup, the ruling half-goblins opted to establish an elite corps of goblin and human guardsmen armed with a combination of seven-barrel muskets and Sunscorch Handcannons, both of which were wielded to devastating effect.

Even the False-Sun flamethrower could not sate their desire for infernal destruction, so they continued to make more and more deadly flamespitters. It was with the advent of the 19th century that they created the ultimate weapon to harness fire in the form of the appropriately named Sunwielders. These humans and goblins are clad in 2-meters tall Damestear-powered exosuits bristling with weapons. In both hands it holds flaming greatswords and in its wrists are False-Sun flamethrowers. On one of its shoulders there is either a device made of lenses that reflects and magnifies the burning heat of the sun into the enemy, on its other shoulder is a gigantic sunstone cannon which fires chunks of sunstone the size of human heads, capable of annihilating concrete walls. Its faceplate is a blank piece of gilded steel with two eyeholes burning with magefire (which can also be used as a weapon), contrasting with the rest of the mech which is the color of ash and lead. These mechanical avatars of divine wrath are thankfully extremely rare, with just slightly more than a hundred in existence due to the immense amount of money and effort that goes into the creation of just a single one, but when they are deployed, nothing can stop them."

Unfortunately for the Overclan, their enemies soon learned that, despite being free from conventional logic, the immolator was not immune to the laws of physics, and exerted a massive amount of weight upon the ground it tread. As such, it was entirely unusable on difficult terrain or soil softened by rainwater.

 islanders_14_far_ridersDESCR:0 "Being so far from civilization and surrounded by centaur hordes, the cavalrymen of the frontier forged a semi-nomadic culture along the edges of civilization, barely heeding the authority of the Federation and becoming increasingly difficult to manage.

A new corp of cavalrymen made up of the sons of wealthy families is raised, armed with rifles, pistols, and sabers and armored with a golden cuirass and mask. They undergo a similarly grueling training regimen to the regulars. Their usual tactic is to skirt the enemy flanks while firing upon them, once the infantry begins to advance they charge, scattering the opposition in preparation for the infantry's bayonets."

Rather than using the usual mass charge tactic of the centaurs, the Dunnenh only get close enough to open fire with their pistols, grabbing a new one from their belts rather than reload to keep up their rate of fire.

Each Dunnenh would be armed with 8 pistols and clad in lamellar armor.

They eschew the use of firearms, their masks make them too hard to aim. Instead they're armed with javelins and long lances. They begin their attack by slowly trotting towards the enemy, with their own ranks spread out. As they near the enemy they pick up speed and move closer to each other, running at full gallop and shoulder to shoulder by the time they meet the enemy, breaking through them with a surge of steel. Every Great Iombürvlait is accompanied by a staff of supporters to carry, maintain, and replace their equipment out of combat and serve as skirmishers in the heat of battle."

A Keaghilyüd will only fire 2 or 3 shots from any one location, packing up and moving to a new firing point to avoid being caught in melee, their only defense in such a situation being a saber and a few pistols."

Though they hail from many cities and cultures, Bom warriors were often called ‘Teplins’ by their employers in Rahen and Thidinkai in reference to the famous mercenary lords of Lapnam Amrik. Traditionally, Teplins went into battle with large shields and a short thrusting sword designed to slip between the plates of lamelar armor. Teplin mercenaries were feared for their reputation as cold-blooded killers, their six-man squads isolating and swiftly slaying soldiers near the edges of enemy formations and crumbling the line from the outside in."

Equipped with gambeson, spear, and war sickle, Yan levy soldiers were durable, dependable, and stalwart even in the face of enemies such as Harimari, Oni, or Shuuvush raiders. Used to facing down enemies physically much stronger than a man, Yan tactics were those of maneuver and counterattack, with a focus on enveloping overcommitted foes after preventing them from breaking the lines with shock tactics."

War Elephants and Sirtani horsemasters were resilient to the short Kerasa blade that was so deadly against infantry, and the wars fought by Bhuvauri, Bim Lau, and Baihon Xinh in the 1400s featured significant numbers of mounted warriors. Though they did not abandon their shields or blades, pikes began to emerge as the primary weapon of the Teplin until first contact with the enemy. Once engaged with the enemy infantry, the Kerasa still found great use, its heavy blade strong enough to cut through a pikeshaft in two or three strokes, its edge a potent render of men."

In response to these major shakeups,Yan states began to institute extensive conscription practices, ballooning army sizes. Military spending also increased, and levies were equipped with standardized equipment, crossbows, and metal armor that improved their survivability and unit cohesion."

In fact, the Hinphat’s long association with the dwarves had imparted them with knowledge of firearms manufacture and dwarven military theory. When armies from Baihon Xinh marched north to subdue the Hinphat in their attempts to reconsolidate the empire, they were met by sulfurous shot and shining shields and pursued by axe-wielding warriors. As gunpowder technology spread throughout Haless, many armies would employ variations on the Hinphat fighting style that successfully rebuffed Baihon Xinh."

Beginning with cannons and progressively miniaturizing, Yan armies made broad use of hand cannons and early arquebuses in their formation.

In Chien Binhrung, the traditional war panoply of officers featured ostentatious breastplates studded with gems from the legendary crystal mines of the coastal mountains. At range, this encrusted armor proved to be surprisingly resilient to small arms fire, and enabled Binhrung warriors to close to short range with reduced casualties compared to their foes in Kudet Kai or Sirtan. While expensive to produce, the vanguard forces equipped with the encrusted lamellar armor of Binhrung were better protected than nearly any other armies of the period."

After the triumph of the rebellion and the establishment of Lanjunhui as a stable power on the lower Yanhe, the academy would continue to be a place of military iteration, and would produce a highly trained officer core capable of commanding the large gunpowder armies growing in Yanshena. The cross-formation, which featured broad arms arrayed in a double defensive cross, originated from the minds of the academy, and proved its efficacy at the storied Battle of Jianzin in 1548."

Adapted for military purposes, kai soldiers grew capable of cultivating chi to the point they could produce bursts of flame, send gales of wind, manipulate water and move earth. Naturally the cultivation of these skills led to less proficiency in firearm warfare, but these soldiers served as the elite shock troops across the Kai realms."

 halessi_19_yanshen_smokersDESCR:0 "As the states of Yanshen began to focus on firearm formations, having a clear line of sight for firing lines became essential to warfare. Preventing the required sight lines needed to make these formations effective thus became equally important. Yansheni soldiers began carrying smoke grenades to obstruct the vision of enemy formations, and warfare often involved disrupting one section of the enemy formation with smoke grenades while the smoker formation focused fire on the unobstructed sections of the enemy line."

Their once-dominant faith slowly relegated into ever shrinking jungles, surrounded by hostile powers on all sides, the remaining tribes that remained loyal to the old ways were extremely proficient in guerilla warfare. When the land awakened and the spirits rose once more, however, the tides turned against the enemies of the Mystic Accord.

The key to their success was their Sunrise Legions, modern human divisions using imported Cannorian weapons who were commanded by elves who had spent decades if not centuries studying the art of warfare. While some would think that centuries old elves would have outdated notions of warfare, the military academy in Azkare placed great emphasis on modern tactics and strategy."

 halessi_28_12-wall_formationDESCR:0 "The 12-Wall fortresses of Khabtei Teleni are renowned across haless for their near impenetrability, but a fort is only as strong as its defenders. The formations adopted by Khebtei Teleni naturally placed a great emphasis on defensive tactics, and harassment, stratagems that served them well in the Bomdan jungles. In addition to their rifles these soldiers would often have an excess of grenades which could be easily lobbed at encroaching armies from behind the safety of the 12-Walls. These tactics were sometimes seen as cowardly by outsiders, but the opinions of those with depleted armies and exhausted populations mattered little to the Lord Mayors of Khabtei Teleni."
 halessi_28_spirit_slingers:0 "Spirit Slingers"
 halessi_28_spirit_slingersDESCR:0 "Immediately after the worst of the Spirittide abated, many Halessi states sought to utilize the destructive power of the spirits for their armies. Through artifice, the power of a spirit could be siphoned and used to craft magical ammunition and explosives with elemental properties and high armor penetration. The extreme difficulty and cost of producing such weapons, however, meant that a battalion of soldiers would rarely have more than two “Spirit Slingers”, and each spirit-armed soldier would possess no more than a  half-dozen rounds of enhanced armaments. Nonetheless, those divisions armed with spirit-empowered weapons consistently triumphed over those who couldn’t or wouldn’t exploit the spirits, cementing the use of spirit-enhanced weaponry in Halessi warfare."

Despite this precipitous loss of territory and power, the return of the necropolis spirits that once guarded the city made Bim Lau nearly impregnable. Focused solely on the defense of the Necropolis, the living warriors  of Bim Lau would  fight tirelessly alongside their ancestors to ensure the freedom of the city, knowing that they would rise again to defend the Necropolis should they fall.  From their great fortification, Bim Lau stood defiantly free throughout the 19th century despite the best efforts of Raheni and Cannorian powers."

 halessi_30_xinh_barrage_infantryDESCR:0 "Cay Cam Sinh was one of the first ports with a major Cannorian presence in Haless and thus was the point from which Cannorian ideas on warfare arrived and spread on the continent. Inspired by the quality of Cannorian armaments and the efficient reloading of Cannorian infantry, Baihon Xinh sought to model their army after the Cannorians. They would import and eventually produce Cannorian arms, drill their soldiers according to Cannorian Doctrine and send their generals to Cannor to learn their strategies of war. This would lead to Baihon Xinh boasting one of the most modernized armies in Haless, with troops capable of firing with greater precision and reloading faster than most other Halessi armies could manage."

The costs of feilding armies equipped with all the experimental equipment one could muster became prohibitive, even for the wealthiest states of Yanshen. This led to the Yansheni adopting standard mass produced rifles and placing more emphasis on military drill and order instead of experimentation. These more standard armies eventually settled upon  using square formations as an  offensively and defensively balanced fighting force."

These dragoons would function like normal dragoons, where they would travel on horseback to find advantageous positions and fire whilst stationary. The only difference was that the Yan exemplified the ceremonial pomp tenfold, and these dragoons often wore bright colours, feathers, capes and all sorts in battle, earnign their moniker: the 'Colour' Dragoons."

The dissemination of a high-powered repeating crossbow design during the late 1400s drastically improved the effectiveness of harimari crossbowmen at range."

 east_harimari_12_thousand_splinter_defenseDESCR:0 "While the massed infantry formations favored by the Yan were effectively combated with crossbow volleys, the emergence of the Shuvuush as a major threat to Yanshen forced changes in the tactics of the eastern harimari. To combat the great terror birds of the northern riders, the harimari began to embed their crossbowmen within pike formations that could ward off cavalry. The combination of spear and crossbow became known as the “Thousand Splinter Defense” — its proponents noted that the name described the thousands of sharp shafts the enemy would encounter in battle; its detractors stated that few casualties were inflicted on the enemy because of the defensive nature of the formation, and that it was little more painful than a splinter."

Widespread use of firearms among the eastern harimari first began in Jiantsiang, where the greater penetration and longer range of these weapons proved its value against swift Shuuvush raiders. If the bird riders refused to give battle and face a Splinter Formation unit, musket fire from arquebusiers embedded in the unit could inflict losses on the Shuuvush from great range, whittling down their numbers and forcing them to quit the field."

 east_harimari_15_roaring_tiger_monksDESCR:0 "The martial artists of the Crouching Tiger school developed new techniques for both combating and integrating gunpowder weaponry during the many conflicts of the 16th century. Adopting a more aggressive stance to prevent enemies from firing upon them in the first place, the monks also began to use gunpowder themselves. Gunpowder fuses were attached to spears and lit to spray shrapnel and blind enemies when the monks closed to attack, whereupon they integrated their classic spear and claw weapons with braces of pistols that could be drawn, fired, and discarded as they cleaved through enemy formations. The great cacophony made by the monks' gunpowder weapons would lead to them being called “Roaring Tigers” in contrast with the earlier Crouching Tiger warriors."

 east_harimari_19_shattering_roarDESCR:0 "The Crouching Tiger martial arts school continued to refine its techniques for the changing age of warfare. Improvements in metal-casting and chemistry allowed for the large-scale production of grenades, which were eagerly adopted by the Crouching Tiger school for their ability to shatter a prepared enemy formation and allow the monks to close on the foe in the resulting chaos."

The classic “porcupine” formation of the defense was gradually replaced by a hinged “pangolin” formation composed of smaller subunits that could pivot and move independently instead of staying as a large and static block."
 east_harimari_23_streaming_volley_infantry:0 "Streaming Volley Infantry"
 east_harimari_23_streaming_volley_infantryDESCR:0 "The tactic of volley fire spread throughout Yanshen during the Great Insubordination of the Hobgoblin Commands as a favored tactic of the Dragon Command. Quickly recognized as superior to the old pike and shot formations that had dominated the region for the past century, line infantry became the standard array for Yansheni armies afterward. Three or four-line deep formations would rotate firing, retreating, and reloading to keep up a constant stream of projectiles to shred enemy formations. The advent of volley infantry also saw the first major integration of humans into east harimari armies, requisite to satisfy the need for manpower created by the expanding army sizes of the era and the higher casualty rates of this new form of warfare."
 east_harimari_26_prowling_rifles:0 "Prowling Rifles"
 east_harimari_26_prowling_riflesDESCR:0 "The surprising success of Xia Shadow Warrior hit-and-run tactics at defeating Dragon Command armies during the early 1700s caused many to mimic their tactics. Dedicated skirmishing units were equipped with rifles for superior range and accuracy and sent on wide flanking maneuvers towards enemy artillery and rear officer positions. Circling around the edges of battle, these units would directly strike at cannoneers, dispatch hostile officers, and raid supply trains and depots to disrupt enemy logistics and reduce morale."
 east_harimari_30_golden_stripe_infantry:0 "Golden Stripe Infantry"
 east_harimari_30_golden_stripe_infantryDESCR:0 "The Golden Stripe was a braided rope, dyed deepest gold, granted to veteran soldiers and worn across the chest of the warrior. Historically given only to those who had served for 10 years and seen action in at least 3 major battles, the Golden Stripe was considered requisite to advance to the rank of sergeant. While ensuring that these officers were all battle-hardened and experienced, this practice also badly restricted the ranks of field commanders available to eastern harimari units. Changes in military training and education that would culminate in the granting of a ceremonial golden stripe to all new soldiers did away with this cultural restriction and greatly improved the ability of the eastern harimari to field capable officers."

 east_harimari_10_hupeng_cavalryDESCR:0 "Lacking the wealth required to raise and train war elephants, for centuries the Harimari of Yanshen have bred a strong and fearless breed of horse, the Hupeng. Allegedly originating from Sirtani stock, they lack the aversion to our people most equines have and many are raised from foals by their riders, creating a lifelong bond of loyalty between mount and rider."
 east_harimari_18_mounted_stalkers:0 "Mounted Stalkers"
 east_harimari_18_mounted_stalkersDESCR:0 "Though they are swift, strong, and loyal beyond question, there are situations where fighting from the back of a Hupeng is unwise. As gunpowder weaponry grew in penetrative power, it was able to defeat even the strongest of armor, and the noble Hupeng could not be protected on the field of battle. Rather than risk their mounts needlessly, the eastern harimari cavalry began to abandon direct cavalry charges and instead adopted Dragoon tactics — skirmishing and running down fleeing enemies on horseback, but spending the majority of the battle riding to where they were needed, dismounting, and fighting on foot."
 east_harimari_23_four_winds_cavalry:0 "Four Winds Cavalry"
 east_harimari_23_four_winds_cavalryDESCR:0 "The Four Winds were elite mounted forces of harimari in Thidinkai that followed the tactical tradition of the Sirtani. Racing across the field of battle on horseback, the Four Winds were armed with a lance and brace of pistols. They would swiftly engage the foe, fire a full volley from their pistols, and then wheel away, skewering enemies with their lances as they went. After reloading, the Four Winds Cavalry would return to the field, often from a completely different direction, to continue their assault."
 east_harimari_28_harimari_dragoons:0 "Reformed Hupeng Dragoons"
 east_harimari_28_harimari_dragoonsDESCR:0 "Improved husbandry methods and superior metallurgy made the Hupeng both far more widely available for military use as well as improved the spear and sabre equipment of the dragoons. Now clad is reinforced breastplate and sporting rifled pistols, the dragoons were fiercer and faster than ever before."
