 khet_mandate.50.d:0 " For some time our [Root.Heir.GetTitle] was exhibiting shameful conduct, and many in the court were worried about the effects this could have in the state after [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] ascension to the throne. Recently, however, [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] behavior has improved significantly, and surprisingly the one responsible for this change is no other than a Khet infamous for sharing our heir's flaw and carrying it to extreme degrees. Apparently he approached [Root.Heir.GetName] in private and convinced [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to change [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] conduct. He explained that while in a Khet like himself such behavior is tolerated, that is only because of the divine blood flowing through their veins and the amazing powers they can use to favor the realm as compensation. Mortals, on the other hand, have both the duty of living a virtuous life and the privilege of having wills strong enough to do so, as most of the Khet simply are unable to overcome the decadent tendencies that come with their nature."

 khet_mandate.92.d:0 "Since our efforts to increase the supply of cotton, a clothmaking boom has emerged in the empire. One of the Khets has grown particularly fond of this newfound influx of quality artisan clothing he's been receiving, to the point that he spends most of the day sweeping through his closet adoring his collection, before finally deciding what to wear.\nAs a result, he has decided to bless his main suppliers with fresh facilities, filled with large amounts of coin and leisure facilities for both the workers and himself, for whenever he wants to visit them."
 khet_mandate.92.a:0 "A Khet on a catwalk, you say…"

 khet_mandate.93.t:0 "A Landscape Artist"
 khet_mandate.93.d:0 "For a few years now, the landscape of the Sorrow has been filled with walls of sugarcane on its shores, walling off the river from the prying eyes of society. It has become such a common sight that the administration almost didn't notice new fields popping out of nowhere, away from any recorded plantations. This turns out to be a whim of a particular Khet, who loved the landscape so much, he decided to spawn sugarcane near his new residence, which unsurprisingly, the administrators also didn't know about."
 khet_mandate.93.a:0 "Ok, where's the issue?"
 khet_mandate.93.b:0 "Cut it down, except for the vicinity of his residence"

 khet_mandate.94.t:0 "What's Sweet Can Become Rotten"
 khet_mandate.94.d:0 "Sugar. A sweetener sought in the farthest corners of the world for how revolutionary it can be to anyone's diet, allegedly improving almost each dish's taste. Unluckily for us, one of the Khets has grown too fond of it, indulging himself in sugar feasts made of sugar powder, sugarcane, sugar sculptures and sugar-filled... anything. It has become so grave that said Khet now demands an entire industry dedicated to himself and he won't back down unless he's satisfied."
 khet_mandate.94.a:0 "He found something better than catnip"

 khet_mandate.95.t:0 "A Little Too Bustling Market"
 khet_mandate.95.d:0 "Our extensive dedication of fields to cash crops has caused an unusual phenomena to happen. Kheterata is not producing enough food! The rich are forced to import it from abroad, but due to our embargoes the supply is not enough to feed the poorest families. The simple folk are accusing the Khets' lavish lifestyles and the Steward's incompetency in vouching for their boons for this situation, as the poorest are ready to explode in a violent revolt."
 khet_mandate.95.a:0 "What do you mean? Sugar is edible"
 khet_mandate.95.b:0 "Accomodate the peasants"

 khet_mandate.96.t:0 "Feeding on Mother's Sorrow"
 khet_mandate.96.d:0 "Our extensive dedication of fields to grow outrageous amounts of grain has caused an unusual phenomenon. The sheer amount of crops and the irrigation initiatives required for them have caused the Sorrow's levels to go down. Following this development, the Khetarch reported that all of the Khets are feeling worse as a result. He demands we introduce preventative measures, including province quotas to tone down the most farming-intensive provinces."
 khet_mandate.96.a:0 "Oblige to Khetarch's concerns"
 khet_mandate.96.b:0 "A lot of people will starve if we stop"

 khet_mandate.97.t:0 "Sensitive to Sound"
 khet_mandate.97.d:0 "The Khets possess a number of powers that the common folk and even magically-gifted can envy. Depending on their mood they can either part the Sorrow to flood entire armies or construct a vulnerable contraption that feeds them grapes. This time, a Khet has decided to torture the Steward with cacophony of sounds seemingly out of nowhere. Numerous voices screaming over each other, already unbearable in their volume, were then overridden by his message:\n\n"Too loud, make it stop." \n\nIt turns out that the amplified hearing of Khets doesn't particularly match well with a prosperous market town nearby and he would like this noisy problem fixed."
 khet_mandate.97.a:0 "Increase the distance between the stands"
 khet_mandate.97.b:0 "We all have to make our sacrifices"

 khet_mandate.98.t:0 "The Best Sunbathing Spot"
 khet_mandate.98.d:0 "Sometimes, the population of Kheterata likes to overinterpret the Khet's various shenanigans. They can interpret a sleeping Khet as a sign for everyone to stop their labour, or the crashing of the barge as a bad omen. This time a Khet has climbed a palm tree at the highest point of the sun to enjoy some sunbathing. The local priest of Khet has interpreted this as a coded message from the Khet, that the Steward reaches too far, where only Khets can reside. Naturally everyone has become hysterical and outright rebellious towards [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule."
 khet_mandate.98.a:0 "Let him be"
 khet_mandate.98.b:0 "Persuade him to get down"

 khet_mandate.200.t:0 "Fate of Koroshesh"
 khet_mandate.200.d:0 "Koroshesh has always been a rich region, and under our control it has continued to prosper. Immense riches are moved every day by the many ships that visit its ports, and the luxury goods the local craftsmen produce are desired in every corner of Halann.\n\nBut some believe it could be richer, that the ships could be more numerous, the craftsmen more productive, the people more wealthy. With the objective of achieving this a plan has been designed,the result of the collaboration of the most prominent interest groups of Koroshesh, including the powerful trade conglomerates, the ancient Koroshesh Lapidarist Guild and many of the most outstanding scholars of the Grand Library. It has been presented to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in an extensive document beautifully crafted by the best gnomish scribes of Kheterata. Its main point is the concession of major political and economical autonomy to Koroshesh, which would henceforth be ruled by the Korosheshi League, a council composed of representatives from the aforementioned groups. The League would receive extensive trading privileges and liberties, and in return they promise to drastically increase trade revenue, bring significant economic development and benefits to both Koroshesh and our whole country, and unconditionally support the state in any manner necessary."
 khet_mandate.200.a:0 "We will be rich!"
 khet_mandate.200.b:0 "There is no need for any of this."

 khet_mandate.200.tooltip3:0 "This offer will not be given again"

 khet_mandate.201.t:0 "Crisis in the League"
 khet_mandate.201.d:0 "The League had been embarking on more frequent, larger and riskier business ventures, and reinvesting copious amounts of capital into their region. That is precisely why it was so surprising when we found out that they have fallen into bankruptcy and been forced to stop all operations.\n\nIt seems that the leaders of the League had been growing more and more confident since we granted them autonomy due to their numerous successes and the economic development they sponsored. That confidence turned into hubris, and they failed to consider the risks of their own ventures. Recently, they experienced a series of catastrophic failures in major enterprises, and with most of their capital invested in different projects they did not have the funds or liquidity to react, resulting in their collapse and ruin.\n\nFixing this mess will undoubtedly cost us plenty of time, effort and money, especially if we want to try and save the League and their investments. We have ample justification to dismantle them and revoke their privileges and autonomy after this failure. On the other hand, they have already proven that they can be extremely useful, so we could rescue them and allow their continued operation with new leadership and increased supervision.\n\nSome of the boldest members of the League propose a more radical option. They argue that the only thing this fiasco proves is that the League did not have enough resources. They believe that the best option to recover from the disaster and achieve the maximum possible economic development is to merge the League with the government, creating a trade empire the likes of which the world has never seen before."
 khet_mandate.201.a:0 "We will not allow them to disappoint us again"
 khet_mandate.201.b:0 "The League will rule the Sorrow!"
 khet_mandate.201.c:0 "Rescue them and allow their continued operation."
 khet_mandate.201.tooltip:0 "\nWe will §Rnever be able to integrate§! §YKoroshesh§!"

 khet_mandate.202.t:0 "A Question of Identity"
 khet_mandate.202.d:0 "With the Korosheshi League now ruling over the entirety of our country, the question of what should the official state name be has arisen. Kheterata is a prestigious denomination that would signal us as heirs to the most ancient human civilization. It would be a nice gesture towards the Kheteratan non-Korasheshi cultures of our empire. However some fear that it could dilute our identity. They are instead favourable to maintaining the term of Koroshesh, which is after all the heart of our new empire and the seat of the League."
 khet_mandate.202.a:0 "A new Kheterata rises!"
 khet_mandate.202.b:0 "We cannot forget our roots."

 khet_mandate.211.t:0 "The Many Skills of Koroshesh"
 khet_mandate.211.d:0 "The children Koroshesh are of course great traders, but they are also so many things more. Among them are bold seafarers, masterful architects specialized in hydraulic works and knowledgeable scholars trained at their Grand Library. The Delta Gnomes communities shine especially in this regard, producing some of the greatest artisans, scribes and calligraphers the world has ever seen. Our agreement with the Korosheshi League allows us to benefit from the many talents of these skilled individuals."
 khet_mandate.211.a:0 "I had never seen so many gnomes at court!"

 khet_mandate.212.t:0 "Kingdom Jewel"
 khet_mandate.212.d:0 "The Nisetataa are the trademark of the Korosheshi Lapidarist Guilds, gems painstakingly faceted with 56 cuts. The careful crafting process requires incredible skill and can take decades to complete, but when finished it results in an unparalleled focusing catalyst for mages. They receive their name, meaning Kingdom Jewel, from the enormous price they reach, exceeding that of a small kingdom.\n\nOne of the greatest gnomish artisans of Koroshesh has recently finished crafting such a gem. He is, however, having a hard time finding a customer able and willing to pay the gigantic sum of money he demands as compensation for his years of labor and centuries of experience.\n\nOur contacts in [event_country.GetName] have informed us of an amazingly wealthy state mage living there, who could be interested in purchasing the gem. We could put the artisan and the wizard in contact in exchange for a share of the sell profits. However, mages are an odd bunch, and we can not guarantee he will be interested. Perhaps we should invest a bit into convincing him to secure the purchase."
 khet_mandate.212.a:0 "Send our finest negotiators and shower him with gifts."
 khet_mandate.212.b:0 "I am sure the artisan will manage to convince him."

 khet_mandate.213.t:0 "Wealthy Gnomes"
 khet_mandate.213.d:0 "The Delta Gnomes communities of Koroshesh have experienced a significant increase in prosperity since we granted the region autonomy. Many have made a fortune by trading or crafting, and the already wealthy families have managed to expand their businesses significantly. Many of these gnomes have decided to spend part of this capital into organising festivals and charity works in their cities, as a way to show their love and gratitude to the people of Koroshesh. While this is of course great, some of our advisors are suggesting that we pressure the gnomes into reinvesting their capital in a more productive way."
 khet_mandate.213.a:0 "We should not interfere with their generosity."
 khet_mandate.213.b:0 "Convince them to reinvest."

 khet_mandate.214.t:0 "Trade Secrets"
 khet_mandate.214.d:0 "Merchants ruthlessly compete with one another to maximise their profits, but that does not mean there is no place for friendship between traders. In fact, sometimes there is a bit too much friendship. This has been the case with a wealthy gnomish merchant from Koroshesh, who had been a trusted partner of the government in many enterprises until now. Recently, he met with a close friend of his, who happened to be a prominent [adjective of the country in question] merchant, and they shared perhaps one to many drinks. Both of them divulged confidential trade information concerning a series of investments that their respective governments were planning to make. Once they sobered up they both took full advantage of the information and obtained a significant profit after buying into some of the areas the governments were going to invest in.\n\nThe information leak did not cause significant harm, in fact it has helped strengthen our ties with the other concerned nation. However many in the court are worried that national trade could be harmed if merchants like this continue having so loose tongues."
 khet_mandate.214.a:0 "There is no need to overreact."
 khet_mandate.214.b:0 "Tell him to watch his tongue if he wants to keep it!"

 khet_mandate.215.t:0 "Koroshesh Prospers"
 khet_mandate.215.d:0 "Koroshesh has always been a wealthy area, but under the rule of the League it is getting richer and richer every day. More ships arrive at ports than ever before, the markets are more active than ever and the workshops have never employed so many artisans. This economic prosperity has led to a population boom, both due to natural growth and to the thousands of immigrants that have arrived to the region from all of Kheterata, searching for opportunities in a place that has many to give."
 khet_mandate.215.a:0 "It is the golden age of Koroshesh"

 khet_mandate.216.t:0 "Offer for Elizna"
 khet_mandate.216.d:0 "The merchants of the Korosheshi League are always looking for opportunities to expand their enterprises and increase their profits. Recently their interest has been directed towards Elizna. The rich and prosperous island, originally known as Ibtat, was gifted by the Khetarch Baqtkhet I to the Sun Elf conqueror Jaher. It is an almost obligatory stop for traders looking to conduct businesses in Bulwar, and it houses many productive textile workshops and tea plantations. As such it is no wonder that the League is interested in it, and it is because of this that they have asked us to transfer control over the island to them, in exchange of course for substantial compensation.\n\nShould we keep this gem of the Divenhal under our direct control, or should we give the Korosheshi a chance to turn it into a magnificent Nisetaata?"
 khet_mandate.216.a:0 "Sounds like the perfect place for a few gnomes."
 khet_mandate.216.b:0 "They have enough land already."

 khet_mandate.217.t:0 "Offer for Deshak"
 khet_mandate.217.d:0 "The city of Deshak, capital of the homonymous kingdom, was originally founded as a Kheteratan colony, from which the great mineral wealth of the mountains was extracted and shipped to the Sorrow. The city has been invaded multiple times and it was almost completely destroyed by the Onslaught. It would later become the first place to be ruled by the Crodamos dynasty, and in more recent times it suffered a devastating gnollish invasion that led them to seek protection under the king of Eborthil. It holds the gate to the Divenhal, and as such anyone seeking to control the trade in this sea must also seek ownership of this precious city. This is precisely what the Korosheshi League wants, and they have offered us extensive compensation in exchange for transferring the control of the city to them. The offer is definitively tempting, and with the city in their hands they promise that they, and by extension us, will achieve total control of trade in the Divenhal."
 khet_mandate.217.a:0 "Deshak will prosper under Korosheshi rule"
 khet_mandate.217.b:0 "The city is better under our direct control"

Yet, they act like aristocracy, and it cannot be denied that they exude an aura of nobility.

In exchange for their loyalty of course."

They adhere strictly to their code of conduct called the "Peyimaaw". This code states that all who serve in the Ahati and show prowess in combat, and devotion to Kheterata, should have the ability to climb the ranks, regardless of their background or character. It all stems from the times of Damerian rule over the Sorrow and their devotion to honour and meritocratic rule. We can enshrine this tradition of meritocracy into law to prevent anyone with false pretences or ill motivations from taking up positions of power within the Ahati, thus ensuring their qualifications are up to our standards!"

The local circumstances or in one word; gnolls, morphed them into a hybrid between a merchant guild and a military order, as the Brotherhood's attention is in large part reserved for the protection of the Irsmahpani caravansaries. Many Southern Ahati are both merchant and soldier and hold the continuation of trade in high regard, with only their devotion to Kheterata taking up a higher priority. We could lend them our support and give them priority, which would boost our overall trade and, by giving them more rights, they could lend us a helping hand in solving local problems along the trade routes."

All of this equipment varies wildly in origin and function, making the Ahati look more like a motley band of fanatics than guardians of the mandate. We could remedy this by providing the brotherhoods with state produced and standardised equipment. It would boost both their loyalty and make it easier for them to have repairs done after combat, but it would also entail a hefty strain on our arms production."

This meritocratic form of promotion and upholding of quality within the ranks of the officer corps has shown to be significantly better than having nobles buy themselves into the military staff. It may therefore be a good idea to just enlist Ahati officers into our armies and have them lead on the field of battle instead. It would be costly, and would give the brotherhoods sway over our armies, but at the same time, greatly improve the quality and experience of our officer corps."

While we cannot deny their value in commerce, we do also have to acknowledge that it comes at the cost of their military training and quality. We can, in order to remedy this, encourage them to abandon part of their assets and trade ventures and focus more on military matters instead.

 ahati_events.1.d:0 "Servants of the Sorrow, Guardians of the people, protectors of honour, valour and justice. This is just one way to describe the Ahati brotherhoods, who have since the times of Aakhet the Bronze Dragon been organised as an unrecognised yet highly skilled military order, devoted to the lands of the Sorrow and its denizens.\n\nOrganised in a more militaristic Northern Brotherhood and a quasi mercantile, quasi martial Southern Brotherhood, they form a presence throughout the entirety of the Lands of the Sorrow. They are extremely organised and employ a rather rigid hierarchy, which has given them a level of discipline, rivalled by few. Yet none is judged or treated differently because of their birth, as the Ahati are the epitome of a meritocracy, a leftover from the occupation of the Sorrow by the Damerians, who the Ahati see as one of their primary influences. As such, they have seen many high ranking leaders, who came from the lowest of backgrounds, like Ramash the "Clothless" who had lived as a beggar for years before joining the ranks as one of their best swordsmen, or Siyek "Foultaint" who started as a tanner for the order before proving his worth as a skilled organiser.\n\nAnother thing which sets the order apart is their devotion to Aakhet, the Bronze Dragon. Aakhet once ruled the Kheteratan lands and praised those who showed honour and valour, something which the Ahati have woven into the fabric of their orders. They therefore do not really revere the Khet, and some even accuse them of being nothing more than a dragon cult with a veneer of Khetism as to prevent persecution. They do however put great importance in how the Steward of the Sorrow behaves: Whether the Stewards show that they are worthy, honourable and noble. They want the steward to be an example for all to follow through action; be devoted to the people and to the lands they govern. These standards are to be met, or the Ahati may be provoked into action.\n\nOur employment of the Ahati will grant us a disciplined and professional fighting force, together with providing administrative and economic support, if we so desire. They are a great boon to our nation, at a cost that is."

Most of the Ahati can, after years of training, best most of our officers and specialists in one-on -one combat with great ease. And one such Ahati has now proven themselves to be even greater than that. They have proven to be a great and skilled swordsman, moving as if dancing on the sands. Combined with being a genius strategist and great leader, they make for a perfect advisor to our forces, whether to train our officer corps or create war plans. Luckily we have been granted approval by the Ahati to hire him as such."

No matter what we do, it is never enough for you extremist types, and you don't even seem to really care for results, only your own maddening arrogance!" With these stern words did the governor of [event_province.GetName] storm off back to this office. For days the local Ahati officers and the governor have been fighting with each other over how to fix local problems. Whether it is leaks in dykes and dams, broken roads or more tricky things like unemployment and poverty, the Ahati keep coming back to the governor, demanding immediate action. The governor has made it clear that his resources are spread thin already and that he cannot fix things with the snap of his finger. He now demands that the state intervene and take care of these meddlesome Ahati. The Ahati on the other hand demand the replacement of the governor with somebody more capable, preferably one educated by the brotherhoods themselves. Our advisors think that mediation is the best course of action, but that we could also have them work it out by themselves and just see what happens."

Without a single flinch he unsheathed his sword and decapitates the nobleman on the spot. And as the nobleman's head falls to the ground, the people cheer, as some recall this nobleman having been trouble before.\n\nThe family of the nobleman, alongside other representatives of the nobility, are furious however. They demand the Ahati soldier to be trialled and executed, as he had no right to kill a nobleman, even if he was a danger to commoners.

But we have now encountered this impossibility, or more accurately, improbability. A group of Ahati seems to be extorting caravans for protection money, with those who refuse to pay being attacked by bandits just shortly after. It really seems like these two groups are working together and are hurting trade in the province for their own benefit. They must be brought to justice!"

This has led to the Ahati needing more space for housing and training. They have therefore proposed the building of barracks in [event_province.GetName] to house both their cadets, soldiers and personnel, alongside ours. They think that there is much to be won from having the Ahati and regulars live, work and train together. They will pay the cost of the building, in exchange for future favours."

Were it our rivals? Or was it a family fight that got out of hand? A jealous concubine? An heir who could not wait to ascend the throne? No one can say for sure, and the only thing we do know is that the murder of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has shocked the realm to its core.

Their skill in applying the most beautiful of letters, hieroglyphs, and symbols onto whatever surface desired is unmatched. They are however extremely expensive, as each character is given as much care as the next.\n\nAnd it has now come to our attention that the Ahati, swimming in wealth, have been hiring almost all gnomish calligraphers to decorate their walls, works of literature, and other surfaces, preventing other people from getting their own calligraphy works. Many now demand a ban on the hiring of calligraphy by the Ahati. It would be a unique form of economic interference, and the Ahati would almost certainly protest."

We are called upon by a nobleman and a local Ahati commander over the inheritance of the nobleman's father. The father in question had written a will in which he promised all his possessions to the local Ahati garrison, as he had been good friends with the former commander and had been a regular guest at the garrison, entertaining them with many stories from his many travels to many lands many miles away. The garrison was to get the inheritance, yet the noble son demands that this deal is annulled. He claims the right to the inheritance on the basis of dynastic continuation and the fact that the Ahati are, at least in his eyes, not nobility. He also argues that the former commander, with whom his father was friends, died years ago and that this means that no human connection can be made between the deceased and the beneficiary. We must now decide who will get the inheritance, before the two sides turn to violence over it"

And a band of Ahati have shown this hatred through pure slaughter and destruction by attacking a gnollish village in [event_province.GetName]. They have burned the dwellings, killed not just the men, but the woman and the children too. None have been spared and the smoke of death and destruction can be seen from far away.\n\nAnd while some villages have been lost already, some are still intact and so we can intervene if we wish to. Stopping them would anger the Ahati, but improve our standing with our gnollish subjects. We could also look the other way and let the Ahati rage rain down upon the gnolls as they please."

They hope that their previous experience and training will help them in their application and training.

Overlooking the calm flow of the Mother's Sorrow, our ruler gazed upon the thousands of lights that lit up Kheterata, the great pyramids in the distance, and barges with Khet floating peacefully on the river. It was an otherwise unassuming evening when all of a sudden a vase seemed to have crashed to the ground in the bedchamber of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Curious, [Root.Monarch.GetName] inspected what happened and saw the vase, broken in a dozen pieces, a vase that could not have been blown over or knocked down by an animal, only a human…\n\nAlarmed our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looked for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sword yet it was gone, and before being able to make it to the door they felt a sharp and sudden sensation of pain. A silverlined dragon shaped blade appeared through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, its glint offering our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a last look at themselves before collapsing on the floor.\n\nWhen the great steward was found by the maid, panic ensued within the palace confines. And with the palace closed off, an investigation started, one which would not take long. The head of the Royal Guard upon inspecting the wound concluded that only one type of blade could make such a strangely shaped cut; a Dragonsdagger. And while knives in the shape of animals are not uncommon, in the Salahad, it are only the Ahati who carry Dragonsdaggers: the Ahati brotherhoods.\n\nBut why would they do this, and more pressing, why would they use their own blades when this would almost certainly expose them? These questions would not go unanswered for long as a great ruckus developed in the markets.\n\nThere an Ahati officer stood, flanked by guards, ranting about the misconduct of our late steward. The priest claimed that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the ruling dynasty in general did not have the mandate to be Stewards of the Sorrow any longer! They called for a new steward to rise to the throne of Kheterata, and for the ruling dynasty to vacate these lands immediately. Reports from other cities tell us of similar occurrences. Aakhetist priests or Ahati officers openly denouncing our government and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the streets. They claim that the economy has slumped, that the Khet do not really support us and that the realm is headed towards catastrophe. They make the gullible fearful, and few dare to speak against the Ahati's claim, fearing for their own lives."

The Ahati officers stopped their incessant ranting after a few days and their soldiers seemed to remain at their posts. And as the funeral of the late steward remained peaceful, confusion hit the population. What are the Ahati up to? Are they going to actually attempt to kill the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as well, or are they content with them? Nobody knew, and the government did not dare to ask the Ahati leadership, fearing that this may push them to action. All was quiet, and in hindsight we should have seen it for what it was: a calm before the storm.\n\nIt started in the more far away outposts of the realm; Ahati soldiers and officers all of a sudden, and in many cases in the darkness of the night, marched into local government offices, forts, and other locations where they had already build up their influence.They seemed to have planned for this as these takeovers went without barely any incident. Now the Ahati have started to take control over a myriad of both military and economic centres. They say that they no longer acknowledge our state as the stewards of the realm and therefore are no longer required to remain in our forts and encampments. While some officers have made it clear to the Ahati that they see this as desertion, they refrain from further action as they are aware that taking disciplinary actions could end in open conflict. The Ahati seem to vacate each and all post that is under our command and leave not even a breadcrumb behind. The people are confused and not even the families of the Ahati know what is going on, or so they claim at least. We wonder and above all fear what may come, and so does the entirety of the government. \n\nThe general staff now fears that a civil war is upon us, and that this may well tear our country apart through violence and destruction. Some say that we should attempt to open diplomatic talks with the Ahati, while others denounce this and say that we have pampered the Ahati for too long already and that we must prepare to teach the these traitors a lesson and show them that they are nothing but spoiled and arrogant faux-nobility. And while our staff bickers and fights over what our next course of actions should be, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] seems to remain quiet, paralyzed by the thought of internal collapse. A revolt of those we thought to be loyal to the steward is approaching and it may well change the realm beyond recognition. We cannot know for sure when the first blow will come, only that it will come sooner than later. And for now there may not be much we can do, other than praying to the Khet, gathering our forces and hoping that the commoners will see that we are still the true Stewards of the Khet and the Sorrow."

Even not as the renovation plans clearly showed that the academy would become a heavily armed and fortified citadel which had no place in a location like Aakheta and was more suitable as a borderfort in locations like the Salahad Gate or the southern desert passages. But now it all makes sense, it now makes sense that they were planning for a war all along and that this fort was meant to be the impregnable fortress with walls as sturdy as the scales of the dragon that gave the academy its name.\n\nAnd so as the renovations were finished, the Ahati's revolt started. A massive warning sign that stood there, laughing at us and our cluelessness. The fort has now taken the role of headquarters for the Ahati, with massive amounts of weapons, equipment and food being hoarded within its bronze bellows.\n\nWith this fortress in their hands, the Ahati have truly become a state within a state and are no longer bound to our laws and commands. The Ahati do not fear our justice system anymore, as they were the justice system in these lands. They do not listen to the steward anymore, as they believe themselves to be the stewards.

And while this has both literally and figuratively born fruit for them, we seem to be getting the short end of the stick. The Ahati now use their titles, influence and land to undermine our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the state's grip over taxes and trade.

We are having a hard time keeping the common soldier in line at the moment and have already been forced to increase payments and pension, as to prevent outright mutiny or mass desertion. And even then, getting young men to sign up for service is costing us more and more crowns every day.

Yet as the Aakhetists have started their revolt, these officers begin to show their true colours. Only a very small and select cadre of generals seem to have remained loyal to the state and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and the non-Ahati part of the military staff fears that some of those have stayed only to spy on us. They conclude that a purge of the officer corps will be needed post haste as the more these potential spies stay in their place, the more information they could transfer to their treacherous brethren. Getting new and, most importantly, qualified officers will be costly and take a while.\n\n It also seems that the Ahati loyalists have either destroyed or taken away the blueprints of the brotherhood's fortresses and strongholds, leaving us essentially blind during a siege.

For soldiers are good at taking land, but keeping it loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is something which only the tact and hard work of the scribes, administrators, and advisors can achieve. And for years, those scribes and advisors were trained and hired by the Ahati. What once started as a way to cut costs and to improve the overall quality of the administrative cadre, slowly morphed into an essential part of the state apparatus. The Ahati delivered us some of the most disciplined, loyal, and honourable administrators, their quality far beyond what we could achieve.\n\nAnd it is this which now bites us in the back. These administrators and advisors may be getting their payment from us, they still hold some loyalties to the Ahati, as many would have never gotten the opportunity to even learn basic reading and writing were it not for the brotherhoods. Some advisors have already abandoned their posts or have started to follow orders from the Ahati instead of ours and are abusing their posts to frustrate our efforts and projects. The Ahati have gained a direct look into the mind of the state and its machinations, giving them a massive advantage and leaving our administration filled with traitors, spies and saboteurs.

We have both sworn to uphold justice in these lands and to protect the Steward of the Sorrow in all capacities." The guard looked unimpressed and simply replied: "That is true, yet the fool you follow is no longer the true Steward of the Sorrow. Either you swear loyalty to the true Stewards or you get lost." Angered and irritated, the scribe turned and went back to his outpost to report what had happened.\n\nWe have a myriad of similar occurrences of the Ahati refusing our armies, state merchants, and scribes entrance to towns, forts, or agricultural estates. All of them report that the Ahati have simply stopped acknowledging our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as the Steward and seem to claim the title for themselves, foolish as it may be.

For the Sorrow, for Aakhet!".\n\nThe shouting and chanting of the Ahati swept over the cities and lands, and each and every denizen of the Sorrow knew what was about to come: a war for the soul, faith, and stewardship of the Sorrow. A war like no other before was unleashed. A war between Cat and Dragon, between Khet worshipper and Dragonsworn.\n\nCoordinated by their generals, the Aakhetists in the delta started to march on the remaining centres of power still loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Within a single day they seized the entire region, alongside other pockets of the realm where they established themselves. They are committed to the full annihilation of our state and to the complete takeover of our realm and powers. They claim stewardship for themselves. We must deny them this, even though it may cost us everything. This war will be long, bloody and painful, yet we cannot let a single stronghold, fort, barrack or otherwise Ahatiloyal remain. We must destroy them root and stem and force the survivors into eternal loyalty to us, the true Stewards of the Sorrow. We march to war. For the Sorrow, for the Khet!"

No longer shall they poison our lands with their lies and their threats. No longer shall the cult of Aakhet burn through our lands and kill the innocents.\n\nThe last of the Ahati were defeated near Anarat, having held out in a decrepit ruin with the last of their generals. On the run, but with nowhere to go, they decided to fight until the last man fell, their bodies pierced by bullets, spears, and the wrath of the Steward.\n\nAnd so, peace may return to the land as we round up the remaining dissidents and prepare for the trials. We will not massacre each and every one of the Ahati, as to prevent their kin from seeking vengeance. We will show them the mercy and honour they lost with their foolish aggression against the steward. Justice will be served, peace will return to the lands, and freedom and security will be a guarantee once more!"

In the capital of their vanquished foes, the entire leadership of the Ahati Brotherhoods gathered for the declaration of victory. Standing on a podium, which was normally used for state announcements, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] began to speak:\n\n"Fellow denizens of the Sorrow, remember this day! The day on which the true Stewards of the Sorrow, the followers of the great Bronze Dragon Aakhet, assumed their role as protectors of the people's freedom, the guardians of peace and the deliverers of justice and security. This day will go down in history as the day the Dragonsworn liberated the people from the chains, brought upon you by the kings of Kheterata. There will, from now on, be true order, true justice and true freedom. All who can fight, will get fame, all who can work, shall get renown, and all who show honour, shall be immortalised! Do not fear us, for the Ahati are here to serve the people, to guide the people, to enlighten the people! We will bring you all much. In our new realm there will be…""

We must not only find him, we must also bring him back to the Sorrow so he can guide us in the most difficult task of Stewardship. Our mission will be costly and hard, yet the resources and connections we now possess should help us along very nicely. For Aakhet we shall look, so we may fight alongside Aakhet once more!"

The Ahati have been reorganised to prevent the dragonsworn veterans from wandering the lands and causing trouble, with some strict rules that is. We are now in full control over the brotherhoods and their members swear an oath of loyalty, not to Aakhet or the Sorrow, but to us directly instead. They will be loyal to us until the end of days, and in exchange, they will be given small pieces of land and lower titles again. They will be employed by and through the state.\n\nWith this civil conflict over, can we finally focus on important matters of state again. We can restore our sphere of influence, reconnect with our Medasi and Satrapies, and restore the lands of the Sorrow to their former glory and prosperity. Peace is upon us!"
