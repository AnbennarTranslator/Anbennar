 string_start_northern_isles_description:0 "§g\"We, the people of the Triunic Lakes, agree to henceforth join together in the Lake Federation to bind our republics closer together for the greater good."\n-Preamble to the Lake Federation Founding Document.§!\n\n§OPrimer§!\nThe people of the §YTriunic Lakes§! are a relatively young civilisation compared to the rest of the world. Originally a group of nomadic tribes, the §YKhamgunai§! people first arrived on the lakes in §Y680 BA§!. A hundred years later, more humans would immigrate to the region due to raging hordes of §YCentaurs§!, who fled to §YForbidden Plains§! after §YCastan II Beastbane§! burned down most of the §YDeepwoods§!.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes consists of plenty of arable land and some of the most fertile soil in the world, allowing it to easily maintain a population of millions of people. However, it wasn't until the §YDay of Ashen Skies§! that most of the remaining humans on the mainland migrated to the lakes and established more sedentary lifestyles.\n\nThe Triunic Lakes are divided into three cultures: the §YKhamgunai§! (the original settlers of the land), the §YMetsamic§! (tending to themselves in fortified cities), and the §YZabatlari§! (who have begun to dominate the economy).\n\nThere are also three religions in the region, each representing a lake which in turn represents a goddess: §YKodave§!, §YYukel§!, and §YEnuuk§!.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nThe §YLake Federation§! is in its infancy, only being formed in §Y1441§!. While there were previous precedents of unity such as the §YAmberpact§!, none were as ambitious or as encompassing as the federation, which attempted to finally end the petty internal squabbles of the lakes. However, this was only due to the recent Centaur invasion, which happened to be the largest and most devastating in Triunic history.\n\nNicknamed the §YGreat Incursion§!, the Centaur Shamans made use of the harshest winter ever recorded by locking the frozen lakes in place and using them as ice bridges, allowing huge centaur hordes to invade, wreaking havoc across the south. The path of blood finally ended in §Y1440§! with the hunting of the last shamans in §Y1439§!.\n\nYou lead a city-state in the north, the primary supporters of the Lake Federation. With the scars of the previous decade still largely visible in the lands of your southern compatriots and missing men from your fields, the foundation of the federation is shaky at best. Be aware of any crises that may come, as many city-states such as §YVahjevgiiv§! seek to expand their own domain for their own greed. Keep tabs on the Metsamic city-states, or the federation may well collapse. And still, its only a matter of time before the centaurs reorganise and reap a new path of blood once more...\n\nThe federation awaits your rule. Will you manage to unify the Triunic Lakes? Or will the city-states burn once more, either by their own hands or under the hooves of the centaurs?"

With scores of villages and farmland abandoned, it’s up to you to throw your weight in the federation for aid in the recovery efforts. With roaming bands of centaurs visible so close to your cities, you must not let the north prosper at the expense of your citizens.\n\nO great ruler, do not let the south suffer for greedy men who collect coins and unimaginable riches while your people starve and die of disease. Will you be able to make the north agree to the wishes of the south? Or will you forge your own path for your nation?"

 string_start_ogre_kingdoms_description:0 "§OPrimer§!\nThe Ogres, along with §YTrolls§!, are the last of the §YGiantkin§! in Halann. The §YTrue Giants§! were one of the original races to inhabit the world, eons ago, but fell in a mutually destructive conflict with the §YDragons§! well before the §YDay of Ashen Skies§!. The Ogres claim that they devoured the True Giants and as such gained their strength and power; these cannibalistic beliefs continue to influence their religion (the §YFeast of the Gods§!) and culture.\n\nOgres have long roamed the Forbidden Plains, though the §YGreat Caehn Neagol§!'s conquest of the central steppes coupled with climactic changes after the Day of Ashen Skies led to the Sandmaw Ogres being driven extinct and the §YFathide Ogres§! pushed to the western hills. In AA 28, with the Fathides seemed poised to meet the Sandmaws' fate, their destiny was forever reshaped by the crash-landing of a §YSky Giant Fortress§! into their hills. The inhabitants had perished, and the Ogres gladly feasted on their corpses, regaining their strength and allowing them to survive the long famine years. The chief of the Gravelhide clan, §YGhornma Gravelhide§!, subjugated all the other clans that flocked to the ruins, and formed the kingdom of Maghargma.\n\n§ORecent History§!\nFor centuries, the dominant Ogre Kingdom has remained §YMaghargma§! in the south, which makes its capital in the old Sky Giant fortress. In its prime the Kingdom extorted tribute from dozens of other §YGreat Clans§!, along with a plethora of Centaur tribes who brought slaves and food in return for boons of iron and steel. The northern tribes, however, have remained rebellious ever since AA 125, when §YRoghrin Gravelhide§!'s rivals fled there following his victory in the §YMaghargma civil war§!. The states closer to Maghargma's power base remain loyal, though some of the outlying Great Clans merely pay lip service to their sovereign.\n\nIn 1440, however, the same Centaur invasion that forced the §YTriunic Peoples§! in the East to unify into the §YLake Federation§! in defense also struck westward, and slew Maghargma's ruler Borigg Gravelhide in battle. His son §YZiltagh Gravelhide§! seized the throne, but he was not another in the long line of Maghargma's rulers who were content to merely sit on their throne and eat. A massive ogre, who crushed centaurs whole with a single blow during his counteroffensive against the Hordes' incursion, his rise has been a check to any rebellious tendencies amongst other Ogres.\n\nStill, every Ogre knows one truth above all: the world is eat or be eaten. Will Ziltagh be able to re-establish Maghargma's dominance, quite literally devour the Forbidden Plains, and even crown himself §YMengurkha§!, ruler of all Ogres? Or will one of their vassals consume the fading state and take up its mantle? Or shall it be one of the §YWild Clans§! in the North, who look south with a blend of fear and ambition and wait for the chance to take a bite—or several—of their own, that shall claim dominance and form §YSurkokli§!? The future of the Ogres, and of the entire Forbidden Plains, is up to you."
 
 string_start_religion_triunic:0 "[Root.start_religion_intro]\n\nThe Triunic religions are centred around the three lakes that serve the §YLake Federation§! with each lake representing a goddess. Three head priests interpret the will of their respective goddesses, with the priests below them serving their respective provinces.\n\nThe central and biggest lake represents §YYukel§!, the mother of the two other goddesses. Characterised by a crown of blue flowers and blonde hair, she represents the trade goddess.\n\nThe west-most and smallest lake represents §YKodave§!, the warrior goddess. It is said that she was the one who maintained the strength of her followers when the Centaurs sieged the southern cities. She is always characterised with wearing a steel and chainmail helmet.\n\nThe east-most lake represents §YEnuuk§!, the manufacturing goddess. Always wearing a white veil, it is rumoured she aids those in need and brings prosperity to the north. Many attribute §YQarshtuluu§!’s famous frosted glass to her."

Standing can be affected once the §YAssembly House§! is built via missions, through spending Politics Points in order to use unique §Ydiplomatic actions§! or special actions in the Assembly House decision.\n\n§YPoltics Points§! is a special “currency” that can be earned and used throughout the game, mostly to change Federation Standing as stated previously. This currency is earned over time and through special events as the game progresses.\n\nEventually, you will encounter a plethora of §YFederation Crises§! that will rock the foundation of the Federation, bringing more devastation and infighting into the region. It is up to you how you want to navigate these Crises, and is somewhat like the §YImperial Incidents§! of the Empire of Anbennar.
