They are mostly associated with the Saraco Raheni or Saraka plant. This plant is used throughout Haless in rituals because burning it emits a sweet smell believed to repel evil spirits. Legends state that this sometimes attracts Yakshini spirits, who, enamored by the plant's fragrance, linger around the location where it was burned and bestow luck and fortune upon the area.\n\nNow, it appears that this phenomenon has occurred in the province of [spirit_province.GetName] after a burning ritual was performed. The locals inquire whether they may expand their shrines and seek funds to increase the burning of Saraka in the hope of retaining the spirit's presence."

 spirits.110.d:0 "A traveling shaman has graced our court with their presence, having been rescued from bandits by our soldiers. In gratitude, they offer their services to us, claiming the ability to communicate with certain spirits and seek their blessings for our nation's wisdom. The shaman asserts that they have journeyed through many lands and established unique bonds with several noble spirits:\n\nThe spirit of the Boabang peak, a mountain atop the Phokhao Range. The shaman encountered this spirit while traveling to the Dwarven hold of Verkal Ozovar. Lost and in need of guidance, the spirit offered help, guiding the shaman back to the right trail. In return, the shaman kept the spirit company by taking a longer route. Since then, they claim to regularly converse with the Boabang spirit. The shaman proposes to seek insight from this spirit to improve our bureaucracy and taxation through enhanced mapping and pathfinding.\n\nThe spirit of the watersnake. While traversing the rivers of the Lupulan rainforest to offer spiritual guidance, the shaman once again lost their way. They encountered a wounded watersnake and, instead of viewing it as a threat, chose to aid the creature by removing a sharp tooth and tending to its wound. In gratitude, the watersnake left an egg containing coins and a small bottle of liquor. On occasions, the shaman claims to find pieces of cloth, similar to the bandage they had used, as if the spirit is trying to return it. The shaman seeks to ask the watersnake spirit for wisdom regarding water travel.\n\nThe White Tiger spirit. While traversing the jungles of Bomban, the shaman found themselves lost once more. Desperate, they performed various rituals to appease spirits for help, but none seemed to work until they heard a faint cry from a tiger cub in the distance. Investigating, they discovered a white cub with golden stripes trapped in an old hunting trap. Without hesitation, the shaman freed the cub, only to find that its mother, a forest spirit, was also white. Grateful for the rescue, the tiger spirit guided the shaman out of the jungle and continues to provide reassurance through its roar whenever the shaman experiences fear or doubt. The shaman aims to communicate with the tiger spirit to aid us in fostering a braver and nobler soldiery."

Unfortunately, frauds and tricksters sometimes misuse this trust, as has now happened to us. A shaman claimed to be able to communicate with a great yet unknown spirit who could not only bless our court but our whole nation. Our advisors were skeptical until the shaman performed a spirit summoning in front of our ruler themselves! In hindsight, it seems to have been a simple magic trick without any spiritual involvement to speak of. After agreeing to a ritual, the shaman requested preparation time and a private room. They then snuck away and stole money from our coffers, and they have not been seen ever since."

Now, it appears that a spirit has taken up the role of avenging them and is causing chaos in a small hamlet not far from the capital. The locals report that a goose is attacking any villager it comes across. Initially, we didn't suspect a spirit, but the fact that this goose is using farming tools and small knives as weapons has given us a different perspective.

In [spirit_province.GetName], a once quiet and peaceful community has been disturbed by sightings of what seem to be "flying gongs." The locals find themselves increasingly agitated as these gongs hover over their villages, and speculations abound about visitors from other realms. While the notion of extrahallanial beings might appear absurd and somewhat foolish, the conviction remains strong among many in [spirit_province.GetName] that an otherworldly visitation is on the horizon. In response, they have begun constructing sky shrines, hoping to appease these supposed outsiders with offerings of jewelry, gemstones, and other opulent items. Nevertheless, we suspect that these sightings and "visits" are nothing more than deceptive spirits, toying with the locals. One approach could involve assisting the residents in increasing their offerings, with the hope of placating the spirits and persuading them to depart. Alternatively, some may consider attempting to shoot down these flying gongs from the sky."

After dismissing the possibility of mischievous children being behind these incidents, the local magistrate suspects the involvement of a taunting spirit—one that might be shapeless, skilled at concealment, or even embodied within the stones themselves. The magistrate seeks permission to gather these stones and relocate them to a secure place, hoping that this action might put an end to the attacks."

According to a local hunter, who claims to have survived an encounter with this hybrid, it hides behind foliage, using an irresistible smile to lure its victims closer. Once within reach, the creature swiftly strikes its victims with a rock, dragging the bodies away, leaving no trace behind. Attempts to eliminate it using conventional weapons such as spears, swords, or arrows have proven futile, as they seem unable to harm the creature in any way. The hunter referred to this entity as a "Huo Guai," translating to 'ghost monkey,' and the local community implores [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] to take action. The mages have identified it as a spirit, advising that spirit hunters, though expensive, should be engaged to deal with the situation if a resolution is desired."

The Blue Man presents an imposing figure, towering over three meters in height, and adorned with nothing more than a simple waist sash. Its distinctive features include glowing blue skin and a semi-transparent body, earning it the local moniker, "the Blue Man."\n\nAmong the local peasants, the Blue Man is revered and cherished for its insight, believed to bestow divine protection and bring good fortune. However, the noble class holds a contrasting view, voicing concerns that the longer this spirit remains in the village, the greater the risk of it undermining their authority to rule."

 spirits.119.d:0 "As the harvest season dawns upon [spirit_province.GetName], a multitude of merchants have flocked to the region to trade and procure fresh leaves for drying and selling in their respective corners of the continent. However, this year's harvest presents an unusual twist, with the leaves displaying a mild pink glow and many exhibiting red veins. What's even stranger is the effect it seems to have on people. Those who come into contact with these peculiar leaves become notably more amiable and affectionate, seeking physical closeness with one another.\n\nThe mages speculate that a benevolent spirit has bestowed this enigmatic blessing upon the harvest, though the exact reason remains a mystery to them. Only time will reveal if this effect endures or if it takes a turn for the worse."
 spirits.119.a:0 "Get me some of that tea!"
 spirits.120.t:0 "Million Crown Magpies"
 spirits.120.d:0 "While on palace duty, it is crucial for soldiers to maintain unwavering focus and avoid straying from their responsibilities, no matter the challenges they may face. However, yesterday, a few magpies or spirits disguised as magpies proved to be a distraction for some guards. These ethereal beings enticed the guards with promises of wealth and led them to a small cave, where their word proved to be true—the cave was filled with riches beyond measure.\n\nRemarkably, it appears that these spirits had no malicious intentions towards our guards. Instead, they acted with honesty, delivering on their promise. The guards have dutifully brought the treasure to our attention and have suggested that we find a way to show gratitude to these "magpies" for their benevolence."
 spirits.120.a:0 "Let’s build them a nice bath and birdhouse."
 spirits.121.t:0 "Old Whispers, New People"
 spirits.121.d:0 "A peculiar and intriguing tale has reached our court. In a small village nestled within [spirit_province.GetName], an inexplicable phenomenon has been unfolding over the past few weeks. The village's population has been growing unexpectedly, not due to a baby boom or any foreseeable reason, but rather due to the unexplained arrival of random individuals. These newcomers have no recollection of their origins or identities and appear disoriented, seeking refuge and assistance. The compassionate village has extended its aid and shelter to these bewildered souls.\n\nThe only telltale sign of their arrival is a faint whispering in the wind. Given the spiritual nature of this occurrence, it is in our best interest to offer support and care to these newly arrived inhabitants. Allocating our resources to help settle and accommodate them seems like the most prudent course of action at this time."
 spirits.121.a:0 "Settle these newcomers and help them acclimate to their new lives."
 spirits.122.t:0 "The Last Laugh"
 spirits.122.d:0 "It all began innocently enough, with a few people seemingly enjoying themselves, but soon enough, the mirthful phenomenon expanded to engulf an entire street, then a village, and eventually an entire town. Evidently, this affliction spreads through sound, as the mere act of hearing those already affected is enough to overcome even the most somber and despondent individuals, compelling them to descend into uncontrollable laughter—their final laughter.\n\nThis laughing plague, likely instigated by a malevolent spirit, is spreading with alarming speed throughout [spirit_province.GetName]. In response, we have dispatched medical experts, but tragically, even they fell prey to the infectious merriment. As a measure of containment, our troops have taken swift action, sealing off the affected regions hermetically and plugging their ears with beeswax and cotton to prevent any external sounds from reaching them. Though uncertain of the outcome, this method has, for the time being, curbed the spread of laughter, which, like those it infected, seems to be dying out."
 spirits.122.a:0 "This must be the most twisted joke I’ve ever heard."
 spirits.123.t:0 "Baku, Eater of Dreams"
 spirits.123.d:0 "The people of [spirit_province.GetName] find themselves grappling with a distressing series of remarkably dreadful dreams, robbing them of any joy in their slumber. Upon awakening, they are greeted by the disconcerting sight of a shadowy, elephantine figure cast upon the walls of their homes. This ominous phenomenon is a telltale sign that a Baku has set its sights on preying upon the dreams of the populace, and their suffering will persist until this malevolent entity chooses to depart."
 spirits.123.a:0 "I hope that a nice cup of tea will calm them a bit."
 spirits.124.t:0 "Baku, Eater of Nightmares"
 spirits.124.d:0 "The people of [spirit_province.GetName] have been sharing remarkable accounts of feeling blessed by the spirits, awakening each day with renewed vitality and without any troubling dreams. This phenomenon is likely the result of a benevolent Baku having chosen to make its abode in the region. Though these beings are typically indiscriminate in their consumption of dreams, this particular one appears to have developed a fondness for the people and has assumed a protective role, at least for the present."
 spirits.124.a:0 "Baku has a specific appetite it seems."

 spirits.125.d:0 "The majestic appearance of the celestial spirit, Kirin, near the province of [spirit_province.GetName], has brought about a bountiful blessing of rainfall and enhanced crop fertility for the people dwelling there. The gentle showers not only nurture the crops but also bestow a soothing and purifying sensation upon our lands. The arrival of this noble creature is perceived as a significant sign, affirming the righteousness of our rule.\n\nThe flourishing abundance and the benevolent presence of Kirin are seen as a divine validation of our just governance, evoking a sense of gratitude and awe among the people.

 spirits.126.d:0 "The presence of the celestial Kirin near the province of [spirit_province.GetName] has been marked by a series of calamitous lightning storms and destructive tornadoes, causing significant damage to the region's agriculture and wreaking havoc upon towns and villages. The reason behind the noble Kirin's sudden display of wrath towards our people remains unclear, leaving many to question the legitimacy of our rule."

 spirits.127.d:0 "The province of [spirit_province.GetName] has been witness to a remarkable and unprecedented surge in both agricultural and industrial productivity, resulting in an abundance never before witnessed in the region. Crops now seem to grow almost instantaneously, bearing more fruit and grain than ever before. This tremendous prosperity is attributed by the local populace to a belief that they have been blessed by the great Wuluí, a testament to their diligent labor and unwavering devotion."
 spirits.127.a:0 "The fruit of our labour has become the fruit of the spirits." 
 spirits.128.t:0 "Wuluí, Bringer of Famine"
 spirits.128.d:0 "The province of [spirit_province.GetName] has been plunged into a state of famine and distress, as their once thriving crops have inexplicably withered, their tools have failed, and their materials have broken apart. The once fertile soil has transformed into a desolate expanse of sand and ash, devoid of nutrients necessary for sustenance."
 spirits.128.a:0 "May this punishment be a lesson for all."

 spirits.129.d:0 "The province of [spirit_province.GetName] is in ecstasy after a swarm of friendly bumblebees paid them a visit. The little critters have diligently pollinated the flowers, trees, and greenery of the local population, who now feel safe and secure. They believe Tuiziye, the spirit of insects, has graced them with this visit. The reason for this occurrence is unknown, as Tuiziye can be rather capricious, releasing all sorts of critters at will."
 spirits.129.a:0 "Let us commemorate this with a song about the bumblebees flight!"
 spirits.130.t:0 "Tuiziye, Releaser of Locusts"
 spirits.130.d:0 "The province of [spirit_province.GetName] is in chaos due to a destructive swarm of locusts that is ravaging their crops, flowers, and other greenery. The population fears that they have incurred the visitation of Tuiziye, the spirit of insects. The reason for this punishment remains unknown, as Tuiziye's actions are random and appear to be capricious, both taking and giving as it pleases. Although there is sufficient food to sustain the population, they will remain on edge for a while."

Traditionally, it served as a folk tale used by parents to scare misbehaving children into better behavior. However, to the dismay of the community, it seems that this rhyme has now manifested itself into a haunting reality. A spirit has taken on the persona of the folktale and is abducting children indiscriminately, regardless of their conduct or character. This alarming situation has instilled deep fear among parents, who worry that their own children might be the next victims of this mysterious entity."

 spirits.153.d:0 "Haless, a continent characterized by its diverse spiritual and ritual practices, displays a shared reverence and respect for grandmothers, who hold a special place as the mothers of mothers. This collective veneration is expressed through various means, including rituals, storytelling, and unique traditions. For instance, in a group of hamlets nestled deep within the Lupulan rainforest, the ashes of deceased women are mixed into farming soil, symbolically giving birth to nourishment for younger generations. Similarly, the Phokhao sky cemeteries honor deceased grandmothers by mummifying them in the cold air and regularly offering food, flowers, liquor, and other goods to their spirits, ensuring they watch over future generations.\n\nSamshimoni, a revered spirit representing these venerated grandmothers, has been frequently sighted around cemeteries, ancestral shrines, and spiritual centers. The common people's devoted reverence has been reciprocated, as witnessed in the province of [spirit_province.GetName]. The area has experienced a significant surge in pregnancies and healthy births, coinciding with an increased number of encounters with the Grandmother spirit. Consequently, the population of the province is growing, providing us with more people to recruit and engage in various activities, contributing to the prosperity of the region."

 spirits.154.t:0 "Corrupted by Mara"
 spirits.154.d:0 "Rulers are akin to sheperds, while governors take on the role of sheepdogs, responsible for guiding and protecting the flock without causing harm. However, the unfortunate reality in [spirit_province.GetName] is that our governor has proven to be more akin to a rabid dog, attacking the very flock it was meant to safeguard. This individual has engaged in embezzlement, illicit deals with local gang syndicates, and misappropriated state funds for personal gain. Clearly, we must replace the governor to restore integrity and trust in leadership.\n\nYet, we must also recognize that recovering the stolen funds may prove challenging, if not impossible. Our suspicions are that the governor acted under the influence of a malevolent spirit named Mara, who thrives on corrupting and manipulating the righteous into committing wicked deeds. This belief is bolstered by reports from the governor's own staff, who observed a dark, ominous glow in his eyes and noticed severe sleep deprivation over the past weeks."
 spirits.154.a:0 "Replace the governor, and please get him some help."
 spirits.155.t:0 "Blessed by Cao Bao"
 spirits.155.d:0 "While Haless is well-known for its focus on good stewardship and the necessity of a strong and honorable bureaucracy, humans are still humans. They can and will sometimes be corrupt or greedy, whether due to debts to pay or simply because they crave more and more. The result is the same: the state loses money and standing. However, sometimes we receive help in fighting the eternal sickness called corruption, and it comes from the divine, no less.\n\nOur administration in [spirit_province.GetName] was shocked when the local governor disappeared without a trace. Initially, we suspected that he took off with the local treasury, but the opposite appears to be true. When the new governor inspected the office, he discovered a secret small room filled with hoarded treasure. It seems that the former governor was not acting alone, as within the small room, there was a strange shrine with offerings to Cao Bao, a spirit known to possess people who pray for debt relief and then force them into becoming treasure hoarders. Sadly, what people do not realize is that Cao Bao takes what it wants randomly, and sometimes it is the literal life of the person who called upon them in the first place, as seems to have happened with the governor. All that remains is the question of what to do with the remaining treasure."

We are unsure why this is happening, but it all began with faint voices emanating from some opera masks. Gradually, the communication evolved into clear revelations of secrets that we could not have possibly uncovered ourselves. Eventually, the spirit started disclosing full-blown state secrets about our rivals and neighbors—information only a ruler or their closest servants would possess.\n\nOur spymaster is clueless about why these whisperers are aiding us, but upon thorough investigation by our spies, we have confirmed that the information they provide is true. The only problem lies in our uncertainty about whether these spirits are also aiding our rivals."

 spirits.157.t:0 "The Craving of the Caterpillar"
 spirits.157.d:0 "Many cultures speak of a spirit or ghost that leads people, especially men, to their doom. One such Halessi legend is that of the Maokohnu, short for "The Good Caterpillar Lady." The Maokohnu is a malicious spirit who ensnares married men with her singing and lures them into the forest, never to be seen again. It remains unclear whether they are consumed or used for procreation. However, what is known is that to men, she appears as a beautiful singing lady, while to unmarried men and women, she takes on the form of a gigantic screeching caterpillar with the face of an old hag.\n\nIn a village in [spirit_province.GetName], the Maokohnu has struck, causing a disaster. It all began with a night of disappearances when over twenty men vanished from their homes, walking straight across the rice fields and into the local forest while calling for "The Good Lady." A few people attempted to stop them, but as they neared the forest and the Maokohnu, the faint screeching turned into loud and unbearable screams. The following morning, a search party was dispatched. They scoured the forest but found no trace of the spirit or the missing men. Only after hours of searching did they stumble upon something—a small cave. Inside, they discovered bones clad in torn clothing, covered with what seemed to be wet silk string. They left the cave hastily but took some of the cloth as evidence. Upon returning to the village, their suspicions were confirmed: the clothing belonged to some of the husbands.\n\nWith no trace of the husbands other than the cave's findings, the village sought help from the state. The local governor dispatched a small group of soldiers to investigate the cave further. While they did find more clothing and bones, they found no living soul or any trace of the Maokohnu. At a loss for what to do next, the local governor reached out to us to deliver the news and inquire if monetary support for the widows is possible. Although highly unusual, the governor deems it necessary, as the village lost a significant portion of its working population to the spirit."

This, in itself, is not unusual, as funerals often serve as social gatherings for communities, allowing people from [spirit_province.GetName] to mourn together. However, what stunned everyone was the sheer number of guests who came to pay their respects. A procession of unfamiliar faces graced the event, many clad in clothing styles that belonged to decades, and sometimes even centuries, past.\n\nOnly a few days later did the realization dawn upon the people. Ancestral spirits from across the lands had arrived to honor their departed elder. Generations upon generations of ancestors had gathered to be present. Such an unprecedented visit from our forebears has left the people of [spirit_province.GetName] feeling emboldened and comforted. The knowledge that their ancestors continue to watch over them brings solace and reassurance."

So, when a little girl emerged from the forest, screaming that she had seen an ogre, half the village rallied, arming themselves with weapons and farm equipment to confront and slay the presumed monster. However, they soon discovered that scythes and pikes could take down a physical ogre, but they proved utterly useless against the apparition of one. Any attempts at reasoning with the ghost were futile, as it spoke a long-forgotten variant of the old Oni language and flew into a rage whenever anyone ventured into the mushroom clearing."

He casually took some rice cakes and proceeded to the porch, where he enjoyed some tea with his old buddies, just as he used to do daily when alive. The lady screamed in fear and rushed to her neighbors, who were equally shocked, not just by their neighbor's experience but also because their great-grandfather, recognizable by his military uniform, appeared in their house, meticulously cleaning his armor as if preparing for some drill.\n\nAs days went by, more and more of these encounters were reported, and what made them even stranger was that all these "walking dead" acknowledged their supposed death but acted as if their return was entirely normal. We remain clueless about their intentions or what can be done, and it might be best to let them be for now."

 spirits.161.d:0 "Many Halessi fishing villages are strategically situated in the middle of lakes or large rivers, providing easy access to fishing grounds and offering substantial protection. However, this protection is sometimes compromised by roaming bandits on boats and ships who exploit and harass these vulnerable villages, as the authorities either lack the will or capability to intervene. Such an incident occurred in a small lake village in [spirit_province.GetName].\n\nWhen the local authorities failed to come to their aid, a spirit in the form of a pale lady emerged to assist the village. Adorned in white robes and a wide-brimmed hat, she bore bright red tattoos on her skin. Employing some form of elemental powers, the spirit lady confronted the bandits, forcing many of them, who couldn't swim, into the water and causing the bandit lord to meet his demise, drowning aboard his large Junk ship. Other bandits who sought vengeance and attempted to reach the village also met fatal ends.\n\nLocal authorities have refrained from visiting the village, fearing that the spirit may hold a grudge against them as well. However, it can be stated with certainty that any form of banditry in [spirit_province.GetName] has been quelled, at least for the time being."

This malevolent entity has been launching attacks and abducting people, with young women being the primary targets. These attacks occur during the night when most people are asleep. Orang Minyak seems to possess the uncanny ability to elude patrols and guards by moving silently on walls and ceilings.\n\nThe spirit incapacitates its victims by dripping oil into their mouths, causing them to fall into a coma-like state, and then carries them away into the darkness. Although most of the abducted individuals eventually return, they are deeply traumatized and refuse to communicate with anyone. Our suspicions about the intentions of this oily man are unclear, and as of now, there is no apparent solution to put an end to these horrifying attacks.

These terrifying apparitions don jet black armor, their bodies mere wisps of smoke. Strangely, they seem incapable of causing physical harm, as reports suggest they pass right through people without any tangible impact. Nevertheless, the terror they instill in the residents is genuine, leaving them demanding urgent action to expel these ghostly figures from the forest.\n\nThe fear and anxiety gripping the village have reached a breaking point, as the eerie nightly visits persist. The community seeks respite and a solution to end the haunting. The enigmatic appearance and seemingly intangible nature of these headless horsemen have left everyone perplexed, and they yearn for a way to bring peace back to their lives."

They looted treasures, killed most of the inhabitants, and inflicted unspeakable atrocities upon them. Just before the woman met her own tragic end, she vowed to seek vengeance against all who served and took innocent lives. Now, it appears that her spirit indeed seeks retribution, but driven by fury, she is indiscriminately targeting every young serving man, even those who have not caused harm to others. We find ourselves powerless to halt this spirit's actions, left only to hope that her thirst for vengeance will eventually be satisfied or that she will move on to another place. The village remains in fear, unsure of how to alleviate the haunting presence of this tormented soul."

These eerie lights are infamous for one malevolent purpose: reanimating the dead from their graves, unleashing havoc upon the living. The reasons and mechanisms behind this sinister phenomenon remain shrouded in mystery. When Kubikay sightings occur, disaster is imminent, as the deceased rise from their tombs and launch indiscriminate attacks on people.\n\nIn [spirit_province.GetName], such an alarming event unfolded, prompting the locals to urgently seek aid from the nearby garrison. However, the magnitude of the undead force was overwhelming, surpassing what a local garrison could combat. As a result, regions within the province are being evacuated hastily to prevent the scourge from spreading to other areas. Swift action is of utmost importance, for every victim of the Kubikay becomes one of these malevolent spirits, further swelling the ranks of this dreadful army of the dead. Time is of the essence, and we must act decisively before this rotting legion of death engulfs more provinces."

Nonetheless, everyone is familiar with the tale of Blackfang, a story passed down to children to instill a clear lesson. Legend has it that Blackfang served as a guardian of a small shrine in [spirit_province.GetName] until an angry mob, fueled by baseless accusations of baby-eating, ended her life. The truth of these allegations is highly doubtful, but the outcome was tragically real. According to the lore, Blackfang's spirit now roams the Xianjie, seeking retribution against those who falsely accuse others of crimes they did not commit. While many consider this tale a cautionary fable, it seems that Blackfang has manifested herself in [spirit_province.GetName].\n\nA notoriously unpopular magistrate, known for making false accusations and sentencing locals to boost personal revenue, met a gruesome fate. Snatched by a harpy adorned with dark green wings, black claws, and fangs, the magistrate was dropped from an astonishing height of around 100 meters onto the pavement of a bustling townsquare. The impact turned the once-corrupt magistrate into a puddle of remains, leaving no doubt about the severity of the strike. In the aftermath, Blackfang swiftly flew away.\n\nDespite the sudden and brutal nature of the attack, the locals have not shied away from showing their gratitude. Offerings have been left at a local shrine to honor and thank the spirit for her actions. While some may view it as a mere tale, the occurrence in [spirit_province.GetName] has sparked belief in the vengeful presence of Blackfang. Her legendary pursuit of justice against false accusations seems to have manifested in a truly unsettling manner, sending a powerful message that resonates with the people."

In this regard, the province of [spirit_province.GetName] appears to excel, being renowned for its blessed and contented couples.

This exceptional state of affairs is widely attributed to the benevolent influence of the lovespirit Yueklao. It is believed that Yueklao actively works to nurture and strengthen relationships, resulting in a robust social fabric and enduring bonds among the people of [spirit_province.GetName].\n\nThe presence of Yueklao's favor is evident in the flourishing love and unity that permeate the province. The residents feel blessed by this divine force, which has nurtured and protected their relationships, contributing to a harmonious and fulfilling community. Thanks to the guidance of Yueklao, love blossoms, and the people of [spirit_province.GetName] cherish a profound sense of contentment in their loving unions.

 spirits.169.d:0 "Maintaining healthy relationships requires constant effort, as neglect can lead one or both parties to seek solace elsewhere. Regrettably, in [spirit_province.GetName], this has become more of a norm than an exception, and suspicions point towards the involvement of the spirit called Yueklao. Though formless, Yueklao is known to wield influence over people's relationships and behaviors, both in positive and negative ways. Unfortunately, it appears that [spirit_province.GetName] has experienced the negative consequences, with people now engaging in adultery almost openly.\n\nThis epidemic of infidelity is wreaking havoc on the province, tearing apart the social fabric and undermining its core values and norms. The widespread indulgence in adultery is profoundly damaging to the community, leading to fractured relationships, broken trust, and emotional turmoil. The province is facing a crisis as the bonds that once held people together are being strained, and the repercussions are far-reaching."

 spirits.170.d:0 "Life is indeed fragile, and in the face of the divine and spiritual, it may appear meaningless. Despite this existential truth, those in positions of power, such as mages and rulers, often seek a "solution" to their mortality. Some turn to magic, others to science, and a few venture into the realm of the unnatural. Our ruler has taken such a path, attempting to forge a pact with Ngoho, a spirit renowned in tales for bestowing immortality upon those who seek it.\n\nThe ceremony was conducted with great solemnity, involving ritual chanting by shamans and the burning of incense. In the midst of this sacred atmosphere, our ruler fervently called upon the spirit to grant them immortality. The room fell into a profound silence, and abruptly, all light vanished, replaced by a faint murmuring. During this moment of uncertainty, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nA few seconds later, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness seemingly unchanged. The true outcome of this enigmatic encounter with Ngoho remains to be seen, and only time will reveal if immortality has indeed been bestowed upon our ruler.

During this mysterious interlude, our ruler collapsed to the ground, while the shamans continued their chant.\n\nAfter a few seconds, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] regained consciousness but complained of a powerful and sharp headache. The significance of this symptom remains uncertain, leaving us to ponder whether it heralds a foreshadowing of impending death or if our ruler narrowly escaped the clutches of mortality.

An old lady materialized, entering the village unannounced, and proceeded to visit all the sick inhabitants. She offered them a broth with the delightful aroma of venison and flowers, undoubtedly a soothing remedy. Despite any attempts to stop her, she appeared both physically and figuratively unyielding, determined to fulfill her compassionate mission.\n\nGratitude and reverence filled the village as they recognized the divine intervention of Pyolsong and their ancestors. In response to this extraordinary occurrence, the villagers expressed their thanks and appreciation through offerings and heartfelt prayers.

As a consequence, nearly all the villagers fell ill with the pox, leaving them in a dire and desperate state.\n\nThe gravity of the situation necessitated urgent action, prompting the dispatch of the army to quarantine the province and prevent any further outbreak. Now, the fate of the villagers rests on the hands of time and the power of prayer. The once serene village now stands in the shadow of a dark and uncertain future, as they grapple with the devastating consequences of Pyolsong's wrathful visit.

Recently, it appears that multiple merchants in [spirit_province.GetName] have been blessed by the Vanyaras, experiencing a remarkable surge in profits and sales. The merchants believe that this sudden prosperity is a result of their unwavering honesty and honorable dealings with their customers, which may have been inspired by the influence of the Vanyaras.\n\nThis flourishing trade has not only benefitted the merchants but also brought about additional revenue for the state. The increased economic activity has brought prosperity to the region, fostering hope for a sustained period of growth. The people are hopeful that the favor of the Vanyaras will continue to bless their endeavors, ensuring a bright and prosperous future for the city and its inhabitants.

However, within this bustling commerce, the honesty of some merchants can be compromised due to factors like personal greed, misfortune, or naivete. Moreover, the spirit of Vanyara, the protector of merchants, is known to employ punishment as a means to address a wide range of misdeeds related to fair trade and honest dealings.\n\nIt is unfortunate that the province of [spirit_province.GetName] seems to be facing such challenges. An alarming rise in quacksalvers has emerged, comprising fake doctors, dentists, faulty tool salesmen, and spice merchants peddling colored sand. This proliferation has caused significant financial strain as we endeavor to suppress these dishonest traders and provide compensation to those who have suffered due to their deceitful practices.\n\nThere are strong suspicions that Vanyara's influence may be at play in this distressing situation. Many of the quacksalvers we apprehended were once well-known and respected merchants who now express remorse for their unlawful activities, attributing their transgressions to the influence of the Vanyaras. This complex predicament calls for a concerted effort to restore integrity and ethics in trade within the province. It is crucial to address these issues to maintain the trust and prosperity that trade brings to Rahenni cities while upholding the spirit of Vanyara's protection over honest merchants."

Although mostly invisible, Preta occasionally takes on the form of either a malnourished noble or a plump peasant. Tragically, many have already succumbed to this affliction, and we fear more will perish in the days to come.\n\nInterestingly, it seems that Preta's impact is confined to a specific area, as those who have left the affected region regain their ability to eat.

The mercurial nature of spirits dictates that they have demanded a sacrifice to be an integral part of this grand celebration, as a means of honoring the prosperity they have brought to our realm.\n\nThis has, unsurprisingly, stirred controversy within the court of [Root.Owner.GetName]. Many have called for a violent response to this demand, but such action would likely lead to a disastrous backlash from the spirits, potentially devastating our harvest. Consequently, it has been decided that a sacrifice must be made, though there is still debate over who should be offered. The [Root.Owner.GetTitle] might offer themselves to the spirit, or the heir could be considered, or even the life of a virgin woman, chosen from our population. None of these options are ideal, but we cannot evade the issue and expect it to resolve itself. A decision must be made, however unenviable it may be."

 spirits.221.d:0 "As the rending commenced and the spirits began to manifest in the physical world, the believers of the Godlost faith initially dismissed these occurrences as mere illusions or elaborate tricks performed by Halessi and Raheni mages. They viewed it as a deliberate attempt to discredit their deeply held beliefs. However, as the days turned into weeks and then months, doubts began to creep into the minds of even the most devout followers of the Godlost faith.\n\nThe undeniable presence of spirits actively interacting with the world and engaging with people shattered the resolve of many Godlost believers. Despite their efforts to resist and ignore the ongoing rending, the reality of the situation became increasingly difficult to deny. Spirits were walking the same earth as the Godlost, and their existence was irrefutable.\n\nIn response to this unsettling reality, people began to revisit various old traditions and rituals from the past. They sought solace and protection against the spirits and the rending that was reshaping their world. Over time, a significant number of individuals started to convert to the ancient religions of Haless, drawn to the spiritual practices that had stood the test of time. The once unshakable faith in the Godlost was now being challenged by the tangible presence of the spirits, leading many to explore alternative belief systems in search of answers and security."

 spirits.223.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] stood on his palace balcony, gazing at the tumultuous night sky as he grappled with the overwhelming disaster that had befallen his realm. In a moment of contemplation, he whispered to himself, "What could a single mortal do to change the course of this disaster?" His voice barely audible against the backdrop of chaos.\n\nA mysterious response emerged from the shadows, catching him off guard. "More than most of you could imagine," came the whispered reply. Startled, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the attending rulers swiftly turned their attention to the corner of the balcony, their eyes searching for details in the darkness.\n\nCuriosity mingled with caution as [Root.Monarch.GetName] addressed the shadowy figure. "What do you mean by that?" he asked, his tone a blend of wariness and willingness to hear more. The intruder's response carried no hint of hostility.\n\n"The Left Hand is a pathway to many abilities, some consider unnatural," the shadowy figure revealed. "Abilities that grant power, and with power, you can change the path and future of your nation." As the words hung in the air, the figure extended a dark hand, waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to decide whether to accept this enigmatic offer."

 spirits.224.d:0 "The enigmatic "Great Spirits" had long been subjects of fascination and curiosity among scholars, theologians, and those who delved into the mystical realms. Their origins and the source of their incredible power remained shrouded in mystery, prompting countless individuals to pore over ancient scrolls and myths in search of answers. As the Rending of the Realms unfolded, this curiosity found a powerful resonance in the heart of [Root.Monarch.GetName], the ruler of the land, who yearned to unravel the secrets of these enigmatic beings.\n\nThe ruler's thirst for knowledge concerning The Spirits and their unparalleled magical might was not confined to the palace; it swiftly spread throughout the nation and even beyond its borders. People from all walks of life began to contemplate the possibilities and mysteries surrounding these beings.\n\nOne seemingly unremarkable evening, as the sun dipped below the horizon and cast long shadows across the land, a scholar made a request that would forever change the course of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s quest for understanding. The message was delivered by soldiers, a simple yet cryptic statement that read, "I can teach you how to become as Great as the Spirits themselves."\n\nThis unexpected and intriguing proposition left [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a choice to make, one that could potentially unlock the secrets of the Great Spirits and their extraordinary power."

 spirits.225.d:0 "Exhaustion had taken its toll on the citizens of [Root.GetName]. For months, they had endured the relentless onslaught of the disaster and the intrusion of spirits into their daily lives. They had exhausted every avenue available to them, pouring their physical and spiritual resources into combating the calamity. Sacrifices were made, fortunes spent, and faith tested to its limits, yet there seemed to be no glimmer of hope on the horizon.\n\nThen, one fateful day, a peculiar phenomenon unfolded in the province. A thick, eerie fog rolled in, shrouding the land in an otherworldly haze. Within this mist, an imposing figure emerged—a giant humanoid form with piercing red eyes that peered down upon the local towns. Fear gripped the hearts of the people, for it seemed that the spirits were finally coming to claim them.\n\nHowever, to their surprise, the colossal figure extended an equally massive hand from the depths of the fog. A voice echoed through the mist, promising change and power, and offering a glimmer of hope where there had been none. Desperation and panic coursed through the people as they weighed their options. With no other apparent solutions, they made a fateful decision and agreed to embrace this enigmatic offer, hoping it would bring an end to their suffering."

 spirits.226.d:0 "It was that time of year when the entire nation came together to celebrate one of its most cherished festivals. Each province had its unique way of commemorating the occasion, but this year, there was an added sense of urgency. The Rending continued to dominate the night sky, casting its ominous presence over the land. The citizens believed that by putting in extra effort and devotion during the festival, they might somehow appease the Spirits and bring an end to the relentless chaos.\n\nTwice as much incense burned, filling the air with fragrant smoke that mingled with the scent of various plants and leaves specially chosen for the occasion. Elaborate paper artworks adorned the streets and homes, and the festivals themselves took on a more exuberant and wild character. In the heart of each town, towering pyres blazed, their flames reaching toward the heavens, and their smoke enveloping the entire area.\n\nAs the clock struck midnight, the festivities reached a crescendo. People danced energetically, their movements infused with both celebration and desperation. It was a spectacle of colors and lights, a fervent display of hope that their collective efforts would somehow halt the unending disaster.\n\nThen, a remarkable and unexpected occurrence unfolded. Giant, dark shadows appeared amidst the revelry, seamlessly joining the dancers in their intricate movements. They mimicked the people and even the Harimari, blending into the festival as if they had always been a part of it. The somber shades transformed into vibrant hues, as the citizens continued with their dances and rituals.\n\nOni, both Red and Blue, took part in the festival as well, fully aware of the dire circumstances that had brought everyone together. They danced alongside the people, adding their own unique energy to the celebration. It was a truly special sight to behold, as everyone gave their utmost, striving to appease the spirits and unite against a common adversary—the unrelenting disaster that had befallen their world."

 spirits.227.d:0 "The relentless disaster had begun to take an immense toll on the ruler. Each passing day brought with it a relentless barrage of reports, grievances, and haunting accounts from every corner of the country. From local governors and officials to common soldiers and patrols, stories of spirits haunting areas, disrupting daily life, and even possessing individuals flooded in without respite.\n\nHis troops, once steadfast and disciplined, were now showing signs of demoralization. They faced not only the physical threats posed by the spirits but also the constant psychological strain of living in a world where the boundaries between the mortal and spirit realms blurred and clashed. They were forced to confront terrifying sounds, ghostly voices, and surreal scenes that defied explanation.\n\nEven the ruler's private chambers, a once-sacred sanctuary, were not spared from the intrusion of these malevolent forces. He found himself unable to rest or recover for several days, plagued by the relentless presence of the spirits. They left him with no respite, no moments of peace or solace.\n\nThe toll on his spirit and mental well-being was immeasurable. The burden of responsibility and the overwhelming sense of helplessness gnawed at him day and night. He sat alone in his chambers, feeling the weight of the world pressing down on his shoulders, wondering how much longer he could endure this relentless onslaught."

 spirits.228.d:0 "The presence of spirits on the mortal plane has indeed brought about various changes and challenges, one of which is the haunting accompaniment of spirits that follow soldiers, particularly those who are engaged in battles or traverse past battlefields. These spirits, often embodying the somber and melancholic aspects of war and death, have made their presence known by singing and playing songs that are traditionally associated with funerals and mourning.\n\nWhile these spirits may not always be malevolent, their relentless presence and constant reminder of death have taken a toll on the morale of our troops. Soldiers, no matter their strength of will, are human beings who bear the heavy burden of risking their lives in the service of their nation. The ceaseless sounds and songs of doom, combined with the harsh realities of warfare, have shaken even the most resilient among them.\n\nMaintaining the morale and mental well-being of our soldiers is of utmost importance, as it directly affects their effectiveness in battle. It is essential to address this issue and find ways to mitigate the impact of these spirits on our troops. Whether through the guidance of spiritual advisors, rituals, or other means, we must seek a solution that restores the confidence and fighting spirit of our soldiers while acknowledging the unique challenges posed by the presence of these haunting spirits."

 spirits.229.d:0 "The festival held in [Root.GetName] stands as a unique and memorable event in our nation's history. What began as a grand celebration aimed at appeasing the spirits and halting the Rending of Realms turned into an extraordinary musical extravaganza. The festival managed to attract talented singers, musicians, and bards from all corners of Haless, and their collective performance was nothing short of remarkable.\n\nAs the festival reached its peak and the clock struck midnight, it was as if the spirits themselves were drawn to the melodious offerings of the citizens. Instead of disaster, the spirits embraced the celebration and participated actively. They possessed individuals, forming various groups and bands that played in harmony with the living musicians. It became a musical battle, a contest of notes and rhythms between our citizens and the spirits themselves.\n\nThis extraordinary night of music and magic continued until sunrise, leaving the last bard standing but exhausted from playing for hours on end. The spirits departed satisfied, and their presence continued to bless our nation for several months. Their music uplifted the spirits of our soldiers, providing them with a sense of encouragement and inspiration as they faced the challenges of the realm. This festival serves as a testament to the resilience and creativity of our people in the face of adversity, and it showcases the potential for harmony between mortals and spirits during these tumultuous times."

As he gazes around, his eyes fall upon a bloody circle etched into the ground. Recognition dawns upon him as he realizes that this is the aftermath of a blood ritual, a dark and ancient practice.\n\nQuestions race through his mind. Who could have been sacrificed in this ritual, and for what purpose? He begins to examine his surroundings more closely, taking note of his noble robes and the scars on his arm, both of which seem strangely significant.\n\nWith a sudden realization, his expression transforms from confusion to a devious and knowing smile. It becomes clear to him that he has been reborn, brought back from some unknown fate by the very ritual he now stands amidst. His comment about the unchanging nature of things suggests that he might have had some prior knowledge or experience with such matters.\n\nDetermined to unravel the mysteries of his newly regained mortal life, he stands up and sets out to explore the world around him, his journey filled with intrigue and uncertainty."

 spirits.231.d:0 "As [Root.Heir.GetName] settles into his new life within the palace, he becomes acutely aware of the perception surrounding his role. Many in the court view him with skepticism and consider him to be an ineffectual figurehead, someone easily manipulated or discarded when the time is right. This perspective is, of course, quite different from the powerful and knowledgeable entity he once was.\n\nHowever, [Root.Heir.GetName] chooses to embrace this newfound persona willingly. He pretends to be carefree and prone to making mistakes, cultivating an image of someone who poses no real threat and is content to let others take the reins of leadership. The contrast with his previous existence is striking, and he finds solace in the simplicity of this life, where he can relax and even make mistakes without dire consequences.\n\nDespite his seemingly carefree facade, [Root.Heir.GetName] hasn't forgotten the ritual that brought him back from the brink of some unknown fate. He feels a deep sense of gratitude and respect toward the young heir whose life was sacrificed for his rebirth. In many ways, he sees it as a second chance at life, an opportunity to experience the world anew.\n\nWith his ancient knowledge and formidable magical abilities, [Root.Heir.GetName] knows that he possesses power that far surpasses those around him. However, he bides his time, choosing not to reveal the extent of his capabilities. Instead, he observes the close family members and court members who hold significant influence over the nation.\n\nIn this new chapter of his existence, [Root.Heir.GetName] treads carefully, waiting for the right moment to make his move and perhaps reshape the fate of the kingdom. For now, he continues to play the role of the seemingly unassuming and carefree heir, all the while plotting and planning behind the scenes."

This development is both reassuring and a stark reminder of the conditions of his rebirth. While he understands the necessity of erasing any trace of the ritual, he also acknowledges that this is just the beginning.\n\nAs he continues to navigate his role in the palace, [Root.Heir.GetName]'s attention is drawn to a particular general in the army. It's not just a casual encounter; it's as if fate itself has guided him toward this individual. The scar on his arm itches and serves as a reminder of a past memory—a memory of humiliation and petty rivalry.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName] decides to take action. He confronts the general, addressing the past events that led to his humiliation. While he does so with a measured tone and a certain level of respect, there is an underlying message: he won't stand for such treatment, especially not now with his newfound perspective and powers.\n\nIntriguingly, he proposes a sparring match, a way to settle their differences and perhaps put an end to the lingering tension. [Root.Heir.GetName]'s actions are not only about personal redemption but also a means to assert himself within the hierarchy of the palace. It's a subtle maneuver that sends a message to those around him: he's not just an heir by name; he's a force to be reckoned with."

It's as if an invisible thread of fate is pulling him toward the governor and his son. [Root.Heir.GetName]'s eyes narrow, and his senses become acutely attuned to any hints or clues.\n\nDuring their visit, the governor and his son engage in small talk and polite conversation, but [Root.Heir.GetName]'s intuition tells him that there's more beneath the surface. He notices the son's sidelong glances and hears subtle remarks, all of which suggest that they are playing a game of deception. They even go so far as to paint [Root.Heir.GetName] as the instigator, claiming that he's been giving them the "bad eye."\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName], not one to tolerate falsehoods or manipulation, decides to take matters into his own hands.

The freedom to take over as the ruler when his "father" passes on is within his grasp. He can guide a younger, promising cousin, imparting to them his wisdom and teachings, and then return to the spirit realm, fulfilling the original contract.\n\nAlternatively, he could choose to remain in the mortal realm, leaving his mark on the world. He could strive to improve the lives of the people in his nation, using his knowledge and abilities to enact positive change and reforms.\n\n[Root.Heir.GetName]'s decision will not be an easy one.

They should be closely monitored during their training to prevent any harm or accidents. Additionally, we must conduct a thorough investigation into the origins and intentions of these possessing spirits.\n\nI would advise consulting with our court wizards and scholars to see if they can shed any light on this phenomenon. It may also be prudent to seek the guidance of spiritual leaders or mediums who have experience in communicating with spirits.\n\nWe must proceed with caution and gather as much information as possible before deciding on the appropriate course of action.

The sentries entrusted with watching over this foreboding terrain observed the fog thickening, an unusual occurrence that went largely unnoticed. As the guards stood watch, some half-asleep, a profound event unfolded deep within a long-forgotten crypt nestled at the heart of the temple—a place where Hokuma, the Black Mist of the Demon Hills, stirred from his aeonic slumber.\n\nWithin the crypt, Hokuma manifested as an ominous, inky mist, seething with long-held anger. He rent the crypt asunder, engulfing and extinguishing all life within the vicinity of the complex, showing no mercy to oni or human alike. His form, suffused with an asphyxiating density, left no survivors in its wake. For eons, Hokuma had been harnessed by the oni for his chi and spiritual powers, but that era had drawn to a close. Now, Hokuma is free once more and consumed by an unrelenting desire for vengeance upon his captors. His wrath knows no bounds, sparing none in his wake.\n\nWith the protective wards of the High Temple dissipated, Hokuma could finally exact his revenge upon those who had held him captive. He crushed, dismembered, and tore apart his tormentors bit by bit, employing his shapeless spirit in the same merciless manner that had been used against him. Kindness holds no place in his heart, only an insatiable thirst for retribution against those who had wronged him."

Beyond the palace's windows, Royal guards pointed towards a distant spectacle. Without hesitation, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] approached the windows for a clearer view.\n\nDown the main flowing river Yanhe, spanning miles, a colossal spectral dragon emerged. The legendary Great Spirit let out a deafening roar, his regal head ascending towards the sky, causing the surrounding spectacle to expand with each passing moment. "It's drawing nearer!" The voices of the guards rang out as the massive phenomenon traversed Haless in the blink of an eye. A piercing scream rent the air, flames ascending to the heavens with such magnitude that an entire country could be laid to waste. Beside the windows, those present were violently propelled by the force of the sonic shockwave emanating from the palace. Glass shattered, ribs cracked, guards lay unconscious, and [Root.Monarch.GetName], struggling to maintain consciousness, cast a final gaze upon the mighty spirit.\n\nIn that fleeting moment, [Root.Monarch.GetName] grasped a realization: only those possessing unwavering dedication or an indomitable will could hope to withstand the presence of such an awe-inspiring creature.

Panic rippled through the populace as troubling accounts emanated from various regions, detailing the inundation caused by the majestic river Kharunyana. A tremendous tidal wave devoured not only people but also their homes, and, in some heart-wrenching instances, entire villages vanished beneath its relentless currents.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] struggled to fathom the cause. The court was abuzz with theories, from suspicions of a potent mage's hand to finger-pointing at the oni or demonic cults, though the latter seemed an unlikely culprit for such a catastrophe. Examining the reports, the flooding appeared to be natural, originating both upstream and downstream. Yet, it defied reason, given the absence of heavy rain for several days and the guards' accounts of nothing unusual upstream. Moreover, the unnaturally rapid pace at which the flooding spread was perplexing. What should have taken hours or even days to flood from one point to another had occurred simultaneously across miles, as if the river had surged as one.\n\nA local priest suddenly barged in, hastily kneeling before [Root.Monarch.GetName]. His pronouncement startled the court, though many dismissed him as a deluded old man. "This is mere folklore nonsense," one advisor remarked dismissively. However, their skepticism waned when the guards also rushed in, urgently warning of the river's sudden rise in the province.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] and the advisors hurried to the gate to witness the spectacle. Down the path, the river glowed with a faint azure hue, and suddenly, an otherworldly entity burst forth. Alongside it, the river—bestower of life and wealth to the land—swiftly reclaimed everything it had taken, swallowing it back into its depths. Trailing behind [Root.Monarch.GetName], the old priest approached, his voice trembling, "He seeks to reclaim the riches he once bestowed, ever since his imprisonment in the cold and desolate abyss, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].""

What made the situation even more peculiar was that all these birds seemed to bow, an act that could only be described as reverence, directed toward one of the eastern peaks of the Phokhao Range.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was confronted with a multitude of theories, ranging from unusual migration patterns to the outbreak of a mysterious avian ailment. Yet, among these speculations, one theory stood out distinctly. "The Regal Peahen has awoken," declared an elderly man who claimed to reside in the very mountains in question. His words resonated with a conviction that bespoke honesty, far removed from the demeanor of a liar or braggart. "The Queen of all Peafowl, Phokhao, has risen. Look to the skies."

This time, only a handful of soldiers misplaced their steps, eventually toppling to the ground, now facing disciplinary action. However, a peculiar pattern struck [Root.Monarch.GetName]. With precise timing, the third quake occurred, and at that very moment, a single snowflake gently landed on their face. Gazing skyward, [Root.Monarch.GetName] was perplexed to witness snowfall despite the absence of any clouds.\n\nAs the fourth quake reverberated, a sudden snowstorm materialized and raced toward the temple, sparking widespread panic. People were engulfed by snow and ice, their confusion mounting in the face of this inexplicable phenomenon. Amidst the fog-draped mountains of Xianjie, the silhouette of Hengdz Bowu emerged—a colossal, frog-like Great Spirit. With each leap, this entity summoned snow and storms, casting the region into turmoil.\n\nNow, it is [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s turn to confront the Great Spirit, seeking a way to restore peace and balance to the land, though the challenge ahead looms as formidable as the storm itself."

He watched as the sea swallowed the sun, and the moon assumed its solemn duty, casting the lands in its soothing radiance. It was a much-needed moment of respite for [Root.Monarch.GetName] after the recent calamities that had beset his court.\n\nHowever, this moment of serenity proved short-lived. A deep resonance echoed through the islands, disrupting the tranquil atmosphere. "A storm?" [Root.Monarch.GetName] wondered aloud, his thoughts momentarily preoccupied by the possibility. Another resounding roar followed, this time even more powerful, and the ground beneath him quivered. It was not the sensation of an earthquake, though. With swift resolve, [Root.Monarch.GetName] rose from his seat and hastened toward the palace.\n\nTwo guards and a court wizard approached him with faces etched in alarm as he made his way to the palace. They attempted to speak, but no words emerged, their expressions of awe conveying more than any words could. It was at that moment that the palace was abruptly enveloped in shadow. [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned his gaze toward the source, and there it emerged.\n\nCinulau, The Guardian of The Sea, appeared in all its colossal splendor. This massive whale dwarfed even the largest of the islands, leaping from the inky depths of the black sea. It left a trail of sky-blue energy in its wake. With this unforeseen appearance, it was clear that the serenity of the seas would no longer be assured."

 spirits.714.d:0 "According to local tradition, [Root.Monarch.GetName] regularly performed a small ritual in his court dedicated to Lupulan. This ritual took place at a modest temple housing a monitor lizard. Offerings were presented to the lizard as a gesture of reverence, seeking the favor and blessings of the Great Spirit. Over time, the monitor lizard had grown closer to both the people in the court and [Root.Monarch.GetName]. It was a quiet and observant presence, rarely causing any trouble, though it occasionally snapped at those it found suspicious, including diplomats.\n\nHowever, on this particular day, the monitor lizard was conspicuously absent. Both the guards and advisors interpreted its absence as a dire omen. Search parties were hastily dispatched, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself ventured out with a group to scour the region and its numerous forests in search of the lizard. A disconcerting development occurred as hundreds of soldiers also went missing during the search. Such a mass disappearance was an extreme rarity and a cause for grave concern.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] and his group pressed onward, they eventually arrived at a clearing. After ensuring they could retrace their steps back to the path they had taken, they continued forward. However, a strange and eerie silence enveloped them in the heart of the forest. Suddenly, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found himself alone, separated from the rest of his group. There were no sounds, only an expanse of trees surrounding him. In that moment, he felt an overwhelming sense of doom, fearing that he had been forsaken due to his ineptitude.\n\nNight began to fall, casting the forest into deeper shadows. In the distance, [Root.Monarch.GetName] noticed a faint shimmer at the end of one of the many paths crisscrossing the local woods. All other paths seemed to lead into darkness, and so [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided to follow the shimmering path, hoping it would lead him to safety or at least provide a painless end. He ran desperately, the darkness swiftly engulfing the path behind him, until he stumbled upon a group of guards searching for him, offering him salvation.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] turned away to rejoin the guards, he spotted the monitor lizard. It emitted a soft, radiant blue glow, the source of the shimmer on his path. The lizard appeared slightly injured, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] sensed that a calamity was impending, one that Lupulan would need all the help it could get to overcome."

The morning after such an event, [Root.Monarch.GetName] found himself nursing an intense headache and struggling with strange visions.\n\nSurveying the town center, he was met with a scene resembling the aftermath of an elephant rampage. Buildings lay in ruins, and a trail of destruction led out of the town, extending to other cities, as reports later indicated. Once sober and back within the confines of the palace after the humiliating incident, the court was in an uproar. Reports poured in from across the country, detailing devastation in major cities and a series of raucous parties that had disrupted local peace.\n\nAmidst the reports, a few messages from nobles praised the party. However, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] read the word "party," a vague recollection stirred in his mind. The previous evening, he distinctly remembered being transformed into an elephant within the palace, though how it had occurred remained a mystery. Even the guards had no recollection. All that remained were the memory of his glowing eyes and the visible footprints of elephants amid the devastation.\n\nAs the reports continued to flood in, some began to blame [Root.Monarch.GetName] for initiating these festivals and parties, even though he had neither agreed to nor participated in them.

Palace guards, gripped by panic, rushed to [Root.Monarch.GetName], imploring him to witness the astonishing sight from the balcony.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetName] gazed upon the scene, he was not met with a simple cloud formation. Instead, an unprecedented tempest was unfolding before his eyes—a sandstorm of unparalleled magnitude. What [Root.Monarch.GetName] initially perceived as a potential attack, possibly the work of a formidable mage, was swiftly overshadowed by the extraordinary phenomenon he witnessed within the churning waves of sand.\n\nAs portions of the sandstorm momentarily subsided, an awe-inspiring figure began to materialize. It appeared to be a colossal spectral lion, a creature of mythical proportions. This was none other than the Roaring Ruler of the Desert, a legend and symbol of nobility and strength.

However, despite the peaceful surroundings and the presence of various palace animals, including graceful peacocks and exotic birds of paradise, his mind refused to find solace.\n\nUnusual unease lingered within him, and even the creatures around him seemed to sense it. A scorpion, perched on the railings, fixated its gaze upon the ruler. Baffled and cautious, [Root.Monarch.GetName] attempted to gently shoo away the scorpion, but it remained unperturbed, its focus unwavering.\n\nGrowing increasingly wary, [Root.Monarch.GetName] summoned the guards to remove the scorpion. However, to his horror, his escort suddenly slumped to the ground, lifeless. Panic seized him, and he rushed to the balcony in search of escape, only to find it swarming with dozens of brown scorpions. Even from the fallen guards, scorpions emerged, crawling toward [Root.Monarch.GetName]. In their midst, they raised their pincers as an ominous shadow loomed over him.\n\nDesperation and terror gripped [Root.Monarch.GetName], and as he strained to discern the source of his distress, his eyes widened in realization.

The original meaning of these creatures had faded into history, reduced to ornate symbols of the royal court. However, on this particular day, something felt amiss.\n\nThe two animals, normally kept in harmony, exhibited unusual behavior. They grew agitated, hissing and launching attacks at each other.

He warned of an impending calamity and devastation heading towards their lands. The priest explained that the spirits needed to be appeased or subdued; otherwise, unrest would persist for eternity.\n\nIn the days that followed, the court found itself inundated with piles of messages, requests, and reports.

Finally, after all this labor, [Root.Monarch.GetName] awaited one last report from the court wizards before signaling the end of the disaster.\n\nThen, in an instant, [Root.Monarch.GetName] stood up as a messenger burst into the courtroom. They gestured upwards, and the court wizards, using their magic, channeled their might to launch a magic missile into the sky. It erupted like a colossal firework above the capital, serving as a signal to awaken the Temples from their slumber. Pillars of blue and yellow energy enveloped the lands in their arcane magic, ultimately separating the mortal and spiritual realms. This was something even the most agile elephant could not evade, regardless of its greatness.\n\nAs the evening descended, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a deep breath, finally able to enjoy a peaceful drink."

 spirits.729.d:0 "Marutha wasn't just a ruler; he was also a formidable fighter and a Great Spirit determined to fight for his freedom. Rebuilding the High Temples drained the country's resources and people's efforts significantly. As Marutha asserted his dominance as the true Raja and battled other spirits, we diligently worked on restoring the artifacts and reigniting the magic within The High Temples. While he rested peacefully, we plotted and schemed.\n\nSoon, Marutha sensed something amiss and knew whom to approach. Within the hour, [Root.Monarch.GetName] received reports of an approaching sandstorm at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace. All according to plan. Moments later, two rulers stood facing each other: one on a balcony of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] palace, the other atop a wall of sand charging toward the palace.\n\nMarutha roared, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] watched in silence, offering no reaction. Marutha charged forward, leaving a trail of destruction, while [Root.Monarch.GetName] leaned on the balcony's railings. The court and guards nervously stood nearby, sweating as the Great Spirit charged onward, shaking the earth with his sheer might.\n\nJust before Marutha reached the palace, [Root.Monarch.GetName] raised [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, making a gesture—a signal for the court wizards and a command for the Lion of the Sands to kneel before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. Marutha roared once more, the sandstorm covering the entire horizon. Just inches away from the balcony, a sudden yellow and blue magical wall slammed against the Great Spirit.\n\nMarutha grunted and growled, pushing against the magical barrier cast from the High Temples. The sky flickered as ancient magic clashed with the spirit realm. Marutha fought fiercely but began losing ground, slowly sliding away from the palace. He continued to claw at the magic barrier, only for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to gesture once again for him to kneel.\n\nMarutha's eyes widened in rage before a magical signal was cast into the sky from the palace. The wall of energy intensified, and the Spirit was propelled into the sandstorm behind him. Dust filled the air, stunning the few brave onlookers, leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName] to see a pair of enraged yet saddened yellow eyes atop a bowing feline, before they vanished into the annals of history."

So many resources, tasks, and sacrifices had been made to bring peace to the realm. At long last, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people would no longer live in the shadow of the Great Spirit.\n\nWith a final signal from the court wizards, the High Temple erupted in a flash of yellow and blue energies. The region was bathed in its magical light, dispelling the shadows and potential threats that had loomed. Now, all of those threats were burned away.\n\nShortly thereafter, Gehet Ketine found himself scrambling, dashing through forests and across rivers as the sacred blue and yellow energies engulfed the land. Spirits left and right were drawn into the flood of energies. Even Gehet Ketine, despite being a Great Spirit, could not contend with the warding magic of these Temples. He ran, dodged, dove into the sands, and vanished into the shadows, struggling to hold onto his freedom for the last moments before he, too, was imprisoned once more. This brought relief to the people, ending his nightmarish reign."

 spirits.731.d:0 "With a heavy sigh, [Root.Monarch.GetName] decided, after several hours of arguments from all sides in the court, to finally suppress the twin Great Spirits. Unrest had spread across the country, and there seemed to be no way to manage it, especially with the presence of the two Great Spirits. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetName] resolved to restore the old High Temples.\n\nThis decision led [Root.Monarch.GetName] to juggle the task of keeping both Great Spirits at bay while also organizing all the necessary resources for the reconstruction and restoration of the High Temples. Months and years passed until, finally, the work was completed. By the end, the court had even designed special magical cages to imprison all the swans and tortoises in the court, at least until the activation of the ancient Wards.\n\nAfter so much time and frayed nerves, [Root.Monarch.GetName] activated the Wards with a tired hand gesture, prompting the court mages to send magical missiles into the air once all the preparations were in place. The caged animals became distressed, filling the air with wild noises as the earth shook under the massive surge of magic flooding the lands. It swept away the spirits in its wake, leaving the realm free from spiritual influence once more. Even the animals fell silent, if not faint, for a moment before slowly recovering their composure.\n\nAs the blue and yellow energies passed through [Root.Monarch.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could finally sense peace returning to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life and country. With a final sigh, [Root.Monarch.GetName] took a seat on the throne, waiting for the temples to signal that everything had gone smoothly before raising a toast to a new era of peace."

 spirits.732.t:0 "The Fractured Domain"
 spirits.732.d:0 ""The decision was made long before my arrival," [Root.Monarch.GetName] repeated to the Huli Jing. No matter what [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had said, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the court had spent days contemplating before arriving at this choice. Changing it now was impossible. The people yearned for a return to their peaceful days before the spirits disrupted their lives. Even if [Root.Monarch.GetName] wanted to change course, the court and the elite of the lands would oppose him.\n\nAll [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] could offer was some protection, but for the sake of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] country and the people of Haless, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had to restore and activate the High Temples once more. The past few years had been dedicated to achieving this goal: scouring the lands for artifacts, quelling occasional conflicts among the spirits, and rebuilding the Temples. It had been a tedious and weighty task, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] pressed on. Fortunately, the formidable four spirits remained unaware of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and the court's plans, or at least they didn't understand them fully. Those who did had not gathered enough power to thwart the restoration. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had made sure of that. So much had been invested in the restoration; there was simply no turning back.\n\nAs the final date approached, with the entire court assembled along with several mages, they waited for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to signal the activation of the temples, thus ending the disaster once and for all. "For the peace of this country and its people," [Root.Monarch.GetName] declared before the mages cast a spell into the sky. This prompted the Temples across Haless to hum and erupt in pillars of blue and yellow magic, shrouding the sky before the magic flooded the land with its arcane power. It separated the realms from each other, finally allowing peace to return to the lands once more."

 spirits.733.d:0 "Tughayasa was a rather peculiar Great Spirit, distinct from all others due to its seeming omniscience, its keen intellect, and worst of all, its omnipresent surveillance of all within its domain. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ultimately decided to imprison it after numerous sleepless nights, for even during slumber, a burning sensation lingered in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] forehead, as if the Great Spirit could peer into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dreams.\n\nThe incessant feeling of being observed and the resulting paranoia had become unbearable for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] country's court and citizens. Some believed the Great Spirit had ceased its surveillance, only for the sensation to return. In certain cases, people couldn't discern whether it was genuinely watching them or if their minds played tricks on them. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the court collectively agreed to end this ordeal.\n\nTemples were rebuilt and artifacts were returned. Although it seemed strange, the Great Spirit appeared to comprehend [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] actions and orders. It witnessed the restoration of the temples with minimal resistance. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] wondered if the Great Spirit truly understood [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] intentions. Nevertheless, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dismissed such thoughts, thinking, "What has been initiated must reach its conclusion."\n\nAfter months and years of combating various spirits and disasters, the temples were finally restored. [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] impatiently awaited the final inspection by the court's wizards and priests before receiving approval to activate the temples. Eagerly, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gave the command to initiate the process, and the guards and wizards promptly complied. The temple powered up, emanating a faith-infused blue and yellow magic.\n\nYet, an odd sensation lingered; even with a paper talisman suddenly adhered to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] robe, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] felt no response from the Great Spirit. Both [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and the Great Spirit gazed at the temple, but [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] couldn't tear [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes away from the paper talisman. It was as if the talisman peered directly into its prison, yet it remained passive, merely observing. After a few moments, the temples erupted in magic, unleashing a colorful fountain of blue and yellow into the sky, clashing with the heavens as the magic began to spread throughout the land. The paper talisman on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest gently burned away from the magic, yet it still elicited no reaction; it simply sizzled away without resistance.\n\nAs night fell and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] returned to the court, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] received reports that all talismans and spirits had finally disappeared. They were finally free from its influence!"

Surprisingly, our infrastructure is already struggling to cope with the sheer number of visitors, and the pilgrimage season has not even officially started yet. The arrival of pilgrims not only brings increased footfall to the temples but also attracts merchants and encourages generous donations to the local religious establishments. However, what is perhaps most significant for us is the thriving economic activity resulting from the exchange of money during this pilgrimage.\n\nWith the pilgrimage season yet to reach its peak, we can anticipate a substantial and sustained boost to the local economy in the foreseeable future."

What started as an impromptu event between three scholars under the eaves of the High Temple in [Root.GetName] has grown into a conclave that is rapidly drawing independent scholars from across the region into a surprisingly productive debate that has seen several interesting lines of thought our magistrates, merchants, and tacticians may be able to make use of."
 spirits.407.a:0 "Take heed of our Magistrates"
 spirits.407.b:0 "Our merchants could use the aid."
 spirits.407.c:0 "There is always war to wage."
 spirits.408.t:0 "Loaded with Chi"
 spirits.408.d:0 "It happened during a routine patrol by the local temple guard, which are usually done by soldiers in pairs and are normally uneventful. Though it's not uncommon that soldiers are spooked or ''See things'' as they do patrols,  happening mostly after the sun settles and the area is bathed in moonlight. That's when one curious soldier wandered off into the temple, claiming he saw some faint yellow glow or aura leading into the temple, only to fall unconscious and wake up again in an outer courtyard of the temple. What really happened he can't recall, no matter how hard he tries, and not even mages could help him recover his memory. He does however know that he ventured deep into the temple, through the impenetrable darkness of the temple's heart before it all turned black. And whatever happened there, it loaded his body with chi and opened his inner chi gates. Gaining not only strength but also a wealth of knowledge. We suggest that he is made into a wizard general as he can be a powerful and loyal officer to our realm and ruler"
 spirits.408.a:0 "Bless the Spirits!"
 spirits.409.t:0 "Quarrelling Sides"
 spirits.409.d:0 "It's not too uncommon that priests and preachers come from all across Haless towards the High temples, seeking knowledge, guidance or answers to their faith. But every so often some religious figures tend to spark a heated debate among the priests and worshippers around the temple complex and even across the whole province. In Fact some of the local populace called for the army to stop this nonsense as a few sides and event cults started to get physical upon each other! Such fights are easily stopped since thes Quarrelling Sides are rarely as armed as our soldiers but they remember the fights and insults for quite some time."
 spirits.409.a:0 "I hope a comet Enlightens them"
 spirits.410.t:0 "Ever Growing Attraction"
 spirits.410.d:0 "The high temples are a sight to behold, such massive intriguing and yet mysterious structures standing for gods know how long upon our lands. Ever so often attracts a surge of people to come and settle in such provinces. Sadly at the cost of the growth of surrounding provinces, nevertheless such growth will surely benefit us in the long term if not even attract people and potentially influential people to our court."
 spirits.410.a:0 "As long they pay their taxes it's fine"
 spirits.411.t:0 "Ever growing piety"
 spirits.411.d:0 "One of the unique things about the temples, besides their intimidating size and height, is their ability to invoke the spiritual side of people in the province of a high temple. Soldiers are known after guarding the High Temples for a decent amount of time or after their service time to lay down their arms and join the local priesthood in the temple. Mostly describe it as a religious call within themselves but many officers and court members suggest that the temples do influence the people in a way but don´t know why or how"
 spirits.411.a:0 "As long as only a few change their way it should be fine, No?"
 spirits.412.t:0 "Center of Faith, Center of Trade"
 spirits.412.d:0 "With the High Temple finally standing tall, restored to its previous previous radiating glory, like aeons before it started to attract the masses across of Haless, halessi, Harimari, even dwarves and kobolds flock towards the Temple Complex in search for inspiration and faith. Tho such large influx of visitors quickly brought the attention of the Merchant class and traders too as culture and religion are being exchanged and studied, along with that plenty of exotic trade goods as well, and so a mayor of [Root.GetName] came forth asking for the Ruler to invest some funds to the local province so they may set up a Trade Center in the province"
 spirits.412.a:0 "Seems like the Temples attract not just faith"
 spirits.413.t:0 "Desperate push"
 spirits.413.d:0 "Without a warning one starry night. The local Oni minority for unknown reasons stormed the temple complex. Overwhelming the local sentry before storming into the temple. Alarms were raised and the local militia quickly assembled and rushed into the temple which the Oni started to tear through the deep chambers of the temples, walls torn down, gates and doors smashed as if they were looking for something. Though what specifically they were looking for, we did not find out as the local militia heroically fought and slayed the huge demons as fast as they could to stop the desecration of the temple, which sadly was not enough. Through the ruins we did find some strange artifacts belonging to the Oni and some which did not..."
 spirits.413.a:0 "This gonna be expensive..."
 spirits.413.b:0 "But to push deeper?"
 spirits.414.t:0 "But to push deeper?"
 spirits.414.d:0 "As ordered, the local militia at the orders of our ruler, went deeper into the temple, after the path of destruction left by the demons. Which was easy to notice by the devastation they left behind though judging by the path they systematically plundered through the deep chambers of the Temple Complex. In fact at the very end of the trail we found a group of them, standing in a moderate sized room. All standing on their feet but with their eyes missing their pupils, nothing not even stabbing them caused a reaction, almost like they were unconscious or dead. The militia men moved them as quickly as possible out of the temple, trying to interrogate them later. As for the room where they stopped, its corners and walls were engravings and strange trinkets decorating the walls belonging to none of the religions or people that we know. What shall we do with them Sire?"
 spirits.414.a:0 "After so much damage we might as well sell them to restore the temple, hopefully..."
 spirits.415.t:0 "Sponsored treasure hunters?"
 spirits.415.d:0 "The High Temples, despite their age, are often big targets of adventurers to explore their interiors and find treasures and map out the endless amounts of rooms that they have. Even after so many centuries adventurers still find all kinds of artefacts and trinkets inside them or various and mysterious notes and writing on the wall or old parchments. Today my lord you received a message of a known adventurer band, requesting your permission and some investment to search through one of your High Temples my liege. Tho be aware, sometimes they may do more harm than good"
 spirits.415.a:0 "I´ll take my chances. Prepare the adventurers!"
 spirits.415.b:0 "I´d rather not risk them damaging the High Temples"
 spirits.416.t:0 "The Carvings of the Ancestors: The Monkey?"
 spirits.416.d:0 "High Temples generally abound with embellishments in the form of murals, each narrating its unique tale. While certain paintings find clear and easily interpretable explanations, others remain enigmatic, defying decipherment. Among these enigmatic artworks, one holds the centre stage in an impassioned discourse—what is the nature of this creature? The majority of onlookers and scholars perceive it as a simian entity, yet an assertive faction contends that it is, in fact, a Goblin. The debate has now escalated to a point where these groups have taken to labelling each other as "apelovers" and "Goblingrouppies". At this juncture, our sovereign's intervention is sought to adjudicate and ascertain the true subject of the depiction."
 spirits.416.a:0 "That is clearly a monkey"
 spirits.416.b:0 "A goblin most definitely"
 spirits.416.c:0 "It’s neither you buffoons, get your eyes checked!"
 spirits.417.t:0 "The Carvings of the Ancestors: The Moon"
 spirits.417.desc:0 "An ordinarily unobtrusive wall within the High Temple of [Root.GetName] bears carvings that have endured the passage of epochs. During a visit to the High Temple, our esteemed ruler paused, contemplative. What could that semicircle symbolise? Is it an empty vessel, evoking hunger's grip? Does it encapsulate the Moon's sway over tides? Might it form part of a ritual, a vestige of a bygone custom enshrouded in the mists of antiquity? Or does it harbour an altogether distinct significance, a riddle yet unsolved? Its import cannot be denied! Casting a discerning gaze around, they sought the insights of a groundskeeper, an individual deeply attuned to the temple's essence. As the groundskeeper's gaze alights upon the carving, a moment of contemplative silence passes, and then, with a sudden burst of certainty, they exclaim:"
 spirits.417.a:0 "That’s a bowl, for fruit probably"
 spirits.417.b:0 "That’s the Moon, sometimes at least"
 spirits.417.c:0 "That’s hat. Smart hat"
 spirits.417.d:0 "That’s a beetle, they crawl on the walls"
 spirits.417.e:0 "That’s a cup, you put drinks in them"
 spirits.417.f:0 "That’s a gong, gong goes bongggg"
 spirits.417.g:0 "That’s just a semicirle"
 spirits.418.t:0 "Quarrel at the Temple"
 spirits.418.d:0 "High Temples are typically sanctuaries subject to vigilant oversight by authorities; however, on occasion, unforeseen incidents transpire. A dispute between two merchants within the revered High Temple of [Root.GetName] escalated into a chaotic fight, involving into a clash of at least twenty individuals. Projectiles were hurled, heads bashed, and bodies smashed. While the prompt intervention of local guards ultimately quelled the brawl, tragically, two lives were lost and multiple participants sustained grave injuries. Compounding the distress is the lamentable fact that the temple itself incurred some measure of damage, fortunately not extensive enough to necessitate extensive restorative efforts."
 spirits.418.a:0 "Have the state pay for the repairs."
 spirits.418.b:0 "Demand payment from one of the two parties."
 spirits.418.c:0 "Demand both parties to pay for the repairs."
 spirits.419.t:0 "Cult of the Evil Moon"
 spirits.419.d:0 "The High Temples are like a puzzle we can't solve. Even though we've been near them for ages, we still don't know why they were built or who specifically built them. We know that it was a precursor realm, but the reasons behind them remain a mystery. This mystery has led to some strange ideas over time, like the thought that ancient aliens made them or that they were built by a kingdom that got submerged. Even though these ideas might sound a bit crazy, they've attracted quite a few people. Unfortunately, another idea has caused trouble. A group, more like a cult, has taken control of the High Temple in [Root.GetName]. The cult claims to know the real purpose of the temples. They say the temples, especially their centre, are actually powerful weapons that can be used to destroy what they call the ultimate source of evil: the moon.It might sound really weird and hard to believe, but we need to act and get the temple back from them before they cause serious damage."
 spirits.419.a:0 "Crush those moonies!"
 spirits.420.t:0 "Cult of Sacred Love"
 spirits.420.d:0 "The true purpose of the temples remains a mystery to us. However, this hasn't prevented people from concocting peculiar theories. Whether it's suggestions of a hidden indoor pool that heals all ailments or assertions that it once served as a refuge for an ancient Chickendeity, each theory seems more outlandish than the last. \n\nRecently, a new theory has surfaced, involving a High Temple in [Root.GetName]. A group known as the ''Freelovers'' has seized control of the temple, transforming it into an open-air brothel where all are encouraged to indulge in worldly desires, or so they profess. According to their belief, the High Temples were sacred places where the precursors engaged in almost ritualistic acts of love. And while their theory is undoubtedly absurd and probably won’t take hold, many are calling for the expulsion of these "Freelovers" from the temple before their actions tarnish the sanctity of the entire site."
 spirits.420.a:0 "Give the soldiers some gloves and expel them"
 spirits.421.t:0 "Plundering of the High Temple"
 spirits.421.d:0 "War means devastation and pillaging of holy sites, including the High Temples. And even their profound importance doesn't shield them from being ravaged in times of conflict. The High Temple located in [Root.GetName] fell victim to plundering, resulting in the loss of both ancient relics and more contemporary artefacts. Moreover, the structure itself sustained extensive damage from the ravages of fire. The timeline for reclaiming the province remains uncertain, yet it is evident that substantial repairs are imperative. Our informants embedded within the city report concerning findings: cracked walls, the burning of wooden elements within, and a shroud of soot covering the entire complex. While our aspiration is to regain authority over the structure, we cannot afford complacency until [spirit_temple_plunderer.GetName] takes responsibility and bears the cost of the repairs."
 spirits.421.a:0 "We’re gonna rebuild the Temple and [spirit_temple_plunderer.GetName] is gonna pay for it!"
 spirits.450.t:0 "Plundering of the High Temple"
 spirits.450.d:0 "During their occupation of [From.GetName] our army has pillaged one of the High Temples, whilst this is a vastly important structure it is obviously the fault of [Root.GetName] if the lands of our enemies come to harm due to just conflict."

 spirits.426.t:0 "Curiosity and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 spirits.426.d:0 "After an extended tenure on the throne, during which [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] had heard countless stories and learned of various events transpiring around the High Temple Complexes, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] found [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis]self compelled to visit them. And so, accompanied by a select group of elite escorts, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] embarked on this excursion, led by a high priest who guided [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] through the intricate passageways. The guide meticulously shared their knowledge of the complex and expounded on the numerous theories and practices associated with the temple.\n\nYet, as the guide continued to recount these tales with unwavering diligence, the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s attention began to wane. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] pace gradually slackened, and both [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue of guards inadvertently became entranced by the guiding priest. This distraction led the lord's gaze to fixate on a faint, yellowish hue in the air—resembling wisps of steam—that seemed to beckon [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] forward. Drawn along this ethereal path, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] ventured into one of the many adjacent chambers. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] senses seemed to dull as he followed the path of the soft, golden fog, guiding [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] to an empty chamber. Suddenly, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] was seized by a bolt of lightning, or perhaps some other inexplicable force. As [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] scanned [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] surroundings and emerged from this trance-like state, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] found [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] recollection to be hazy, left only with the impression of a small, vacant room imbued with a golden radiance.\n\nSoon thereafter, the guards hastened to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s side, swiftly ushering [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] away and ensuring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] well-being. Trained physicians attended to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] needs in the wake of this enigmatic episode."
 spirits.426.a:0 "Why am I not a powerful mage yet!!?"
 spirits.427.t:0 "Spark of Wisdom afterall"
 spirits.427.d:0 "After a year of recovering the injury at the High Temple the doctors perform one last check for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Making sure that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body is in perfect shape, along with an Acupuncture session. Hitting all chi points and making sure no bad chi is left in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body after the incident from the Temple, though as the final needle is put inside [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] suddenly jolts on the table, almost as if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was hit by lightning [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body shook! [Root.Monarch.GetHerHimCap] fists clench and the doctors quickly remove the needles before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] slowly gets up unhindered by any injury, in fact [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] never felt better before! The doctors are rather stunned how fast the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] moved as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] tended to lag behind in movement. They ask [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to lay down to check once more only to find out that nothing was wrong? While the doctors spoke and checked with each other the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was already out on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] throne, leading the nation anew into a better direction"
 spirits.427.a:0 "Well, at least I understand why I am not a powerful mage."
 spirits.428.t:0 "An audience for all"
 spirits.428.d:0 "No matter how powerful or knowledgeable someone is, everyone needs a moment to rest and gather their thoughts. Even our glorious Ruler needs a breather if not gather some inspiration. And so he settled for a hill top underneath a chrysanthe tree with a perfect view of the High Temple on the other side of the province. And with a simple bamboo flute he played. Soft tunes playing out his whole life up to this point, the harsh yought, the ever threatening coronation as the new ruler. All the decisions, be it good or bad that brought him to this point under this chrysanthe tree. At that moment only he could be heard, across the small valley, attracting citizens to check the source of the soothing sounds. Gathering people by the hundreds, even smaller spirits appeared around the Tree, everyone listening quietly to the story of his flute."
 spirits.428.a:0 "Once he was done he bows to the crowd and silently ventures back to his Palace"

 spirits.429.d:0 "My lord! We got a report of wild animals attacking The High Temples and the towns around it! We are not sure what happened but all kinds of creatures attacked, from wild dogs, to tigers, even an elephant herd have been seen trampling and attacking the buildings in the High Temple province! We are not sure what attracted them there but we must do something quickly!"
 spirits.429.a:0 "Dispatch the army!"
 spirits.430.t:0 "Wisdom of a merchant"
 spirits.430.d:0 "During one trip to the High Temples the ruler got approached by a merchant of renown. Asking him what's the difference between Faith and Trade? The obvious point was, one was a spiritual matter and the other one a material. "No! But also yes" was the merchant's reply "Both are in principle the same. Exchange one to gain something else, in this case we exchange our time and dedication into faith to get the blessings of Spirits, gods or even oneselves. Trade does that too, exchanging our time and dedication to gain goods, money and wealth. That does not mean that they have to be separate, no? In the end we merchants do also exchange our wealth and goods to enrich ourselves in faith and piety. But there are exceptions on both sides, no? If you are interested I like to discuss some more with you""

Losing the ball inside the High Temple was not an unusual event, but each instance proved to be a nerve-wracking ordeal, shrouded in the chilling darkness below. Despite our hesitance, we ventured into the foreboding High Temple to retrieve our lost ball. Deep within the dimly lit hall, we finally spotted the ball and hastily turned to leave. However, we knew it was already too late. An unsettling sensation crept up my spine, but before I could ponder it further, I rushed to catch up with my friends, climbing the stairs frantically.\n\nJust as I was about to escape the last of the shadows, a sharp pain shot through my ankle. I spun around in horror, only to catch a fleeting glimpse of a malevolent grin retreating into the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and a primal fear overcame me. I let out a blood-curdling scream and sprinted up the stairs, not daring to look back. My breath was ragged as I raced straight home.\n\nUpon my arrival, panting and terrified, my mother brushed off my claims, dismissing them as childish imagination. My father scoffed, attributing the scratch to a stray animal. However, my grandmother, her eyes hollow and distant, whispered with eerie certainty, "They are coming, and our time is running out." The weight of her words sank deep into my soul, leaving me trembling with a sense of impending doom."

 spirits.702.t:0 "Something is Awry"
 spirits.702.d:0 "My father, who had gone blind after years of toiling in the coal mines, lived with me. Alongside my wife and children, we cared for him for years. Despite his blindness, he did what he could to help us—assisting with laundry, attentively listening to the children, and doing what was within his abilities. That is, until recently. One day, upon returning home, I found my wife in shock and grief. My worst nightmare seemed to be unfolding, yet nothing had prepared me for this. My father hadn't passed away; no, he had disappeared.\n\nIn a blind panic, I rushed out of the house and asked neighbors and others if they had seen my father. Everyone gave the same rehearsed answer: "heading towards the High Temple." Confused and with a sinking feeling that something was gravely amiss, I sprinted to the High Temple. And there, I found him. He was kneeling in the middle of a courtyard. As I entered this ancient place of doom, he turned to me with a grin—a grin so wide and unsettling that no human should wear it. I stared at him for what felt like hours; an unknown force rendered me speechless until I managed to croak out, "Dad?" In response, "he" stretched his grin even further, his eyes turning black, and a transparent aura enveloped him.\n\n"Realms fall, rulers perish, and Haless will rend like cloth in the wind," he exclaimed, his voice a cacophony of pent-up anger, vengeful desire, and lustful sadism, as if thousands were speaking as one. After this, he briefly regained his composure and collapsed to the ground, like a puppet discarded by its puppeteer. I caught him, and as I attempted to carry him out of the High Temple, I felt as if thousands of eyes and voices were watching and whispering to me—indistinct but clear in their message: something is awry, and this is just the beginning."

 spirits.703.t:0 "The Rending of the Realms"
 spirits.703.d:0 "For millennia, the High Temples stood as enigmas, constructed in a bygone era by a realm long faded from memory, their true purpose shrouded in mystery. Over the ages, philosophers wrestled with the meanings behind the intricate inscriptions, sages sought to untangle the prophecies they held, and the cursed dared to harness their power for their own ends. And, with every endeavor, they cast yet another "pebble" onto the Temples, each one adding to the countless others, slowly cracking its shell, for a single pebble accomplishes nothing, two achieve little, but thousands of pebbles make a difference.\n\nA scratch evolved into a crack, and a crack into a wound. While a lone wound may evoke little concern, enduring thousands of wounds is insurmountable—much like the fate of the High Temples. Already weakened, these Temples crumbled swiftly, eroded by time's inexorable passage, both in a tangible and abstract sense. Even the most robust walls of the pristine temples succumbed to the torrent of thousands of spirits, suddenly reinvigorated after eons of imprisonment.\n\nThe High Temples shattered. A deluge of spirits—countless in number—flooded streets as if a supernatural tide, rending lands and engulfing nations. From towering peaks to shadowed valleys, the landscape teems with spectral entities. A veritable invasion, as spirits both minute and great converged, driven by a singular purpose: evading the confines of the High Temples and being free once more.\n\nAnd so Haless descends into chaos and fear. Spirits inhabit every nook and cranny, some benign, though most seem to hold an inexorable aggression towards those that dared to suppress them for so many eons. While the spirits reap what we seem to have sowed, our people react in a multitude of ways; spawning doomsday cults prophesying the end, or rallying against the state's paralysis due to the Rending and demanding action. Yet, the majority quiver within their homes—a deceptive sanctuary, as the Rending affects everyone and reaches everywhere."

 spirits.737.d:0 "This proves to be [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] most challenging task yet for the nation. Restoring the High Temples across Haless was one feat, but the Demon Hills lacked a High Temple, and the warding elements in the restored Temples were scarcely understood due to their age. Countless individuals and mages were dispatched to find a method to redirect and ensure the Demon Hills felt the impact of the High Temple's magic. Many lives were sacrificed in vain, but it was a necessary endeavor to halt the impending disaster. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] maintained a cold focus, contemplating the toll these efforts took on lives. Eventually, the nation would recover from this, thanks to the sacrifices made; the future would be better and stronger.\n\nAfter years of reconfiguring the High Temples, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] breathed a sigh of relief. With a small escort, they waited at the borders of the Demon Hills, just beyond Hokuma's reach but close enough for Hokuma to sense them. With a decisive gesture, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] signaled the court wizards escorting them to activate the Temples in the distance, painting the skies with explosive magic. They waited for the heavens to be adorned with ancient blue and yellow arcane colors, dispelling the spirits plaguing the realm before they inundated the demonic Hills. Sensing impending doom, Hokuma resisted as the black fog flooded from the ground and the Demon Hills, clashing against the warding magic of the High Temples. Like two rivers colliding, the black fog began to recede, revealing that even a Great Spirit has limits.\n\nWith arcane magic pushing back Hokuma's might, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] and the escort advanced into the Hills, deeper into the lands and an ancient forgotten temple. They walked toward the heart of the lands, Hokuma's prison. Only a door stood between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and the arcane magic from the High Temples, adorned with countless magic runes and spells. Hokuma, no longer fighting, hid in the only place left, hoping that the little freedom remaining wouldn't be taken away. However, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had no mercy left after dedicating so much time and resources to this cause. With another order to the court wizards, they blasted the door away with all their magical might, flinging it into a room filled with black goo. Though the fog was thick, the blue and yellow magic wrestled with Hokuma's fog, tearing it out and swallowing it back through the door.\n\nThis further enraged Hokuma for a moment, but he had no power left. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] looked with a smile at what remained of Hokuma's might. The arcane magic slowly dissipated, its colors turning darker until they were fully sanguine, whirling past [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]'s body, the only thing Hokuma could see—a black silhouette with a spiral of red arcane magic pooling behind them. "You caused so much damage, but don't worry; with your powers, we can undo that. I can repair the damage you caused." With that, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] emerged from the Temple with their guard, eyes glowing faintly red. They spread their arms, dispersing the fog towards them, now surrounded in a shroud of black and red fog, freeing the Demon Hills from Hokuma's influence once and for all... by placing it under someone else's."

But that lasts only for a few moments before Yanhe shows itself across the lands, casting a shadow of might as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] patrols the River and lands like a King of Kings.\n\nBut it won't last much longer. While [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] basks in the glory of the sun, replacing its spot for the people of the lands, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people work in Yanhe's shadows. While Yanhe indulges itself in the offerings of people and spirits, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people work in the High Temples. While Yanhe rests, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the court spend the nights and countless lives restoring the arcane magic in the Temples. After years, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] can finally walk through the halls and chambers of Tianlou and its High Temple. Well, for a few more moments before Yanhe would approach [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the High Temple. Like a monolith towering over [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s tiny silhouette, gesturing for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to kneel before the ruler of the lands. Alas, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] could only smile, if not laugh, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] casually stretches out [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right hand.\n\nYanhe roars in annoyance that [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] defies his orders. And right before Yanhe could retaliate against [Root.Monarch.GetName], the Temple Complex lights up with gorgeous golden hues before it bursts with arcane magic, pushing the Great Spirit off the Temple Complex. Yanhe takes a moment to process what happens before leaning back, looking toward [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] and the Temple Complex, pouring out a roar and divine-looking flames only to be blocked off by the Temples' arcane energies, which are soon followed by several pillars in the distance as other High Temples activate on the horizon.\n\nOnly causing further confusion to the Great Spirit before several yellow and blue tendrils thrust out from the very river named after the Draconic spirit. Trying to wrap and entangle it. A spectacle to hold as the arcane tendrils and Yanhe wrestle, entangling the spirit more and more with each passing moment till it could not hold itself above the ground, causing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] to crash onto the ground with a huge earthquake before the tendrils drag [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] body into the River, only for the river to gradually be dyed red. The once-yellow-and-blue tendrils, now bursting out of the river, stream right onto the Temple.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] makes [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] known to the people. Addressing them from the top of the High Temple as the glorious golden rays of the sunshine turn red by the Temples. Basked in the blood-red light was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis], causing the birds to take flight. “The disaster has finally finished! I Swear that I'm gonna turn our land into paradise, day by day. Undoing the damage that the spirits left behind and lead us into a brighter future!” as now with the powers of Yanhe, [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] can change fate as [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] desires."

We have suffered beneath the lawless tyranny of the Great Spirits, but now, that shall finally end. [Root.Monarch.GetName] stands above the Kharunyana with a handful of hand-picked court mages and guards, waiting for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] signal. Waiting for hours until [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] finally spots a disturbance in the waters.\n\n[Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand, and the court mages fire a magic missile into the sky. Right as the spectral catfish leaps out of the river to show off its might and ferocity, the Temples on either side of the river begin to glow a dark, bloody red. Coating the sky and heavens in bright blue and yellow magic before it fell down onto the great spirit, catching it mid-jump. The guards cheer while [Root.Monarch.GetSheName] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] other hand. One more magic missile fires into the air, this time a brilliant earthen glow, and the ground trembles as the arcane magic radiating out from the temples change direction, suddenly sucking in the magic that they released.\n\nMeanwhile, Kharunyana squirms and thrashes inside the magic net in pure panic. Trying to resist and break free, causing gusts of winds flying all over the place, noises started to come out that could not be described besides pure pain, and after a few more moments, the yellow and blue-colored magic net started to shift, turning a deep crimson hue. Kharunyana starts to slow down, swaying and wiggling weaker and slower with each passing second before the magic net starts to lower the Great Spirit into the river. The crimson hue now tainting the river, spreading up and down the stream.\n\n“Everything went as planned,” said one of the court mages. [Root.Monarch.GetName] cups [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hands, dips them into the now-red river, and takes a deep sip of the liquid. With a satisfied smile, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] opens [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] glowing red eyes."

Locals were also invited to join the festivities. The festival would commence with a spectacular firework show, primarily to capture Phokhao's attention.\n\nA vast court-like area was constructed with a podium as tall as three people at its center where [Root.Monarch.GetName] would stand. Countless mages were stationed along the walls, chanting and channeling their magic. Once everything was set, another firework blast ignited alongside a massive illusion of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in the sky—tall enough to attract the attention of the Great Spirit. On the ground, a royal speaker addressed the festival-goers, emphasizing the glory and prestige of the ruler of Haless and Phokhao. The speaker declared that the being crowned that day would rule all of Haless, as mandated by the heavens.\n\nWith the speaker finished, [Root.Monarch.GetName] knelt behind them, and the display continued with the massive illusion. Phokhao, tempted into action by the blatant disrespect, leaped from the mountain towards the festival. The spectral peahen’s arrival was a majestic calamity, shaking the earth with each delicate step. The mages were pressed against the walls by the sheer pressure of her wings. [Root.Monarch.GetName], despite it all, remained kneeling, while the speaker held the crown towards Phokhao. The speaker declared, “Now I shall crown the righteous ruler of Haless and Phokhao!” as he presented the crown to the Great Spirit.\n\nPhokhao, the most majestic being in Haless, accepted the crown, even if it was tiny compared to her size. She lowered her head to allow the speaker to bestow upon her this treasure, her beak nearly touching the ground. However, at the last moment, she sensed the true purpose of the mages—the ritual was more than a simple illusion. There was no time for the Great Spirit to react. A sudden splash of scarlet covered the court as two yellow and blue spikes of arcane magic pierced Phokhao's head and torso, splitting into tendrils that enveloped the Great Spirit.\n\nThe speaker turned around, with shaking hands, placed the crown on [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s head, who finally rose to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] feet. From the podium, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] looked down upon the grievously wounded peahen while the mages continued chanting. A red mist started to flow towards her as the High Temples of Haless emitted pillars of ancient magic into the sky and ground, fueling the mages in the court. [Root.Monarch.GetName] spread [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arms in a gesture, showcasing to all of Haless that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was the rightful ruler, with the massive illusion above the city now turned into a red image instead of the colorful robes."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] waited patiently at one of these temples, positioned to lead the ritual that would summon the Great Spirit. Snowflakes drifted gently from the sky, a harbinger of the Spirit's imminent arrival. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] whispered beneath [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] breath, "They are coming."\n\nSeveral court mages stood nearby, ready to activate the High Temple when the time was right. The earth trembled, and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] counted in preparation. "One, two, three…" With a lifted hand, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] signaled the mages, and right on cue, Hengdu Bowu descended from the heavens, causing a tremendous storm to erupt where he landed. Simultaneously, a magical storm of yellow and blue energies surged from the activated High Temple, creating a spectacular clash of elemental forces.\n\nThe Great Spirit leaped into the sky once more, with [Root.Monarch.GetName] listening to the wind, instinctively pointing to the next High Temple to activate. The court mages, following their ruler's lead, launched another magical missile into the air. A pillar of energy appeared on the horizon, met by a burst of blue sparks as Hengdu Bowu descended nearby. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] counted again, "One, two, three…"\n\nThe process repeated as the Great Spirit was led to another High Temple, this time the earth temple, causing a seismic event that sent people to the ground. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] could sense it—the wards of the High Temple had intercepted Hengdu Bowu. Without hesitation, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] pointed to the sky with both hands, and every mage released a missile into the air, creating a dazzling display of lights that illuminated the heavens. The rest of the High Temples activated one by one, while Hengdu Bowu was still recovering, but this time it won't be a simple net of arcane energies capturing the Great Spirit. [Root.Monarch.GetName] had a better idea in mind for the frog spirit. The Arcane energies did not wrap around the Great Spirits, no, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] raises [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand once more, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] gaze firm upon the horizon. And the court mages only nod before shooting a final magic missile into the air. A scarlet red blast bursts in the sky before the earth shakes and the arcane pillars of the towers intensify as in the distance the Great Spirit is getting surrounded by several sharp tendrils of arcane energies, all pointing at the entangled and struggling Great Spirit, who in this state could hear and see the rest blast in the sky before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] visions turned fully red. The frog's eyes grow weary before drifting into a hopefully eternal slumber.\n\nAnd so a single blood-red snowflake landed in front of [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] who gazed back with a pair of deep scarlet eyes. Peace and power finally returned to the land and its people."

Along all vessels heading out, one was filled with civilians—a transport ship scheduled to travel and bring people from one Ringlet Island to another. Vessels such as these are usually shielded by mages against poor weather and opportunistic pirates. With a strong abjuration in place, the ship sailed out through the stormy sea, bouncing and crashing straight through the waves, each one bigger than the previous.\n\nThe vessel continued bravely, but sooner or later, the waves were too big, too strong for it to continue, and it simply was pushed aside. The ship was now helpless; the faint flickers of its magical ward disappearing as thunder strikes once more. The vessel floated with no direction across the sea, panic spreading like wildfire, screams drowned in the storm with no hope in sight. That was when all sound was swallowed as the darkened form of Cinulau leapt from the sea before its colossal body splashed, a massive wave erupting from the Great Spirit's position as it swallowed all others.\n\nThe civilian ship came unscathed, guided by the massive wave towards Cinulau, letting the Great Spirit get a better look at the vessel and the people on it, like a silent guardian, simply observing in the silent moment, before a crack of thunder interrupted the silence. A single small galley was spotted on the edge; on the bow of the little ship was the mage supposed to protect the civilian ship, commanding the small vessels to attack the Great Spirit with its cannons and, of course, arcane magic.\n\nThe spirit whale simply submerged and leapt once more out of the sea, causing a second massive wave to push both ships, the civilians away from the battles before Cinulau falls upon the warships and swallows them whole. The civilians looked nervously back, then erupted in a cheer, but even that quickly drowned as a painful bellowing erupts from the Great Spirit. It had swallowed the bait. A few people were a small sacrifice for the power that such a Great Spirit would offer, and with another horrible echo, the remainder of the fleet emerges from the horizon.\n\nThe poor spirit tries to resist, shakes and wiggles its massive body, like a small island hovering above the sea, causing waves to erupt underneath it, pushing and even turning a few boats upside down, but there were simply too many people, too many harpoons. By dawn, the beast finally gives up, spending a whole day and night fighting off before it's turned into a pincushion. Turning the sea blood red like the dawn that is rising on the east. A triumphant new age rising with the sun, an age led by mortals, an age led by [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

But his power alone was not enough to be a protector of these lands and its people. No, [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court could only end this disaster once and for all. They spent countless resources, charting out the lands, finding and securing these ancient High Temples.

It's enchanted hide, which is now all entangled in arcane blue and yellow colors with an occasional tug before it uses the last bits of its strength to look up at [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\n“I am sorry, but it seems your time is up, but don't worry I will protect these lands in your stead, and with your power, I will secure the future of it as well.” Its lizards’ eyes suddenly sharpen up, looking at [Root.Monarch.GetName] as they bow, doing a gesture of respect before turning away and the entangled web of arcane energies slowly turn a glowing crimson hue, radiating towards [Root.Monarch.GetName] as it slowly paints [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] robes and eyes red.

A plan to lure the festive elephant to a grand feast, conveniently near a corrupted High Temple, was hatched. An invitation sent to the brightest minds of Haless, another of ambitious artists trying to push their news expressions, and a few more to the finest makers of wine and alcoholic beverage, be it human, harimari, elven, and especially the dwarves. The years of senseless partying shall finally end.\n\nA few months pass by as the preparations are done, not only to restore The ancient High Temple Complex but also the preparations for the festival. It shall be a feast of alcohol and mind. Innovations and beverages shall flow for the rest of the evening, nothing is taboo for a festival meant to attract a Great Spirit. Even [Root.Monarch.GetName] spends weeks and months preparing for that event, preparing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind and body for alarming amounts of alcohol consumed and mental tasks and competition by the philosophers from across Haless.\n\nThe Festival goes deep into the night, till the stars are swallowed by the night sky before Dhenbasana is spotted by the court mages. The Great Spirit´s trunk deep inside a river of wine spewing from countless vases filled with the land's finest brews. A firework of arcane missiles is cast to entertain the guests and more importantly to signal the mages inside the High Temple Complex to activate the ancient temple. Gently awakening the ancient building while The Great Spirit indulges itself into its fest. The Magical firework only continues and even intensifies, casting all kinds of colors and shapes into the sky, plenty ones in the shape of an elephant, the image of Dhenbasana as the Great Spirit continues to indulge itself quietly in the background of the party, tasting wine after wine of the lands greatest wines that even Great Spirits like Dhenbasana could not resist their influence, especially the dwarven brews, causing the Great Spirit to loosen up.\n\nOnce that has been spotted, the court mages continue, giving a different signal, causing the earth to tremble a bit. The High Temple complex continues to awaken, radiating a gentle magical glow which slowly spirals out into an arcane pillar that stretches far into the sky. Dhenbasana continues to drink, more and more intensely, its body swaying with each step, weakened by both the alcohol and the magic of the high temple.\n\nEvery passing moment, the Great Spirit grows weaker and in the depths of the night, the Great Spirit gives in, crashing onto a river of alcohol at the edge of the town. After a few moments [Root.Monarch.GetName] comes around to see the Great Spirit finally with their own eyes. The wine being mixed up with some blue and yellow hues among the deep red. With The Great Spirit finally defeated [Root.Monarch.GetName] lets out a sigh before getting closer, using an empty cup to grab some of the wine that the Great Spirit is laying with closed eyes enjoying every drop of it.

Like a tiger on a hunt, he rushes forth, leaving behind a storm and trail of destruction. [Root.Monarch.GetName] orders [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] court mages to prepare one more blast upon the sky, a blast full of vivid colors to signal the High Temples in the horizons to activate, and so they do with an earthshaking activation as pillars of blue and yellow pierce the sky.\n\nBut that did not intimidate Marutha; it enraged him only further as he spirits as fast as possible towards the palace, followed by tendrils of arcane magic coming from the High Temples. Marutha dodges and dances past the tendrils while [Root.Monarch.GetName] watches on top of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] balcony, covering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] face with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] wrist as sand is blowing from all sides from the massive amounts of magic clashing just in front of the palace. “This is it!” [Root.Monarch.GetName] mumbles as [Root.Monarch.GetHeShe] bets all upon this, all the power and might and riches that the arcane magic of the temples gonna take down the Great Spirit.\n\nEven the loyal guards are trembling as Marutha comes closer and closer; the guards by the end flee the balcony.

Marutha does not give up as with ferocious eyes locks on [Root.Monarch.GetName], who yet again does not acknowledge or budge to the Spirit's intimidating glare.\n\nDespite it being impaled, it uses the rest of its energy to lunge once more, but this time a salvo of arcane tendrils erupt from behind [Root.Monarch.GetName] before all thrust into the body of the Great Spirit. Causing it to finally slump down, the arcane magic now tainted and soaked with a crimson hue before they gently turn and sip into [Root.Monarch.GetName], who with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] now crimson glowing eyes, stares down upon the defeated Great Spirit, which only shivers in pain as its energies are being drained. “I am now the true Raja of the desert.” And with a victorious smile, [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks to the future of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] lands."

It's a long-lasting fight, all kinds of tricks, resources, and rituals are brought to keep [Root.Monarch.GetName] awake, not to fall asleep and prey to the Great Spirit. Gallons of caffeine were consumed by the court.\n\nBut just before the final pieces were put in place for the completion of the High Temples, [Root.Monarch.GetName] closed down after over hundreds of days of vigilant resistance to sleep and the Great Spirit. Even the guards could do nothing against [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s body; it was too tired after months of staying awake.

But one thing was for sure, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] would not go down without a fight.\n\nThis resolve was cut short when seconds later, a stinger plunged into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] chest, plunging [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] onto the throne with a tired drop. Now awake, the courtroom is lively, no walls ruptured, the roof still there, guards around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] all worried along with several court members. [Root.Monarch.GetName] thought that [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetSheHe] was finished.

Two quarrelling sisters were simply too much to bear.\n\nOnce the High Temples were restored and repurposed, the main part of the plan sprung into action. Now the mortals went on the offensive. Hukai and Telebei were not without their tricks, however, and hid among the black swans and white turtles of the region. But with the support of the court, funds were prepared, and a nationwide hunt was declared to track down every swan and turtle across Haless. Both the military and court mages were employed, dragging these animals to the nearest High Temple.\n\nThe hunt was not without accidents, people got attacked not just by the animals; spirits seemed on alert and unusually aggressive. Whole groups of search parties went missing in some cases, but with the help of plenty of court mages, using their arcane knowledge and powers, they were able to complete the search after a few more painful months. Once the last one was caught, a signal was fired into the sky, lighting up the horizon, notifying the palace and [Root.Monarch.GetName] about the capture of all animals.

One after another, the sky gets pierced by pillars of arcane blue and yellow arcane energies. All the captured swans and turtles went into a frenzy as the room where they are caged in was being flooded with the ancient magic. They bash and slam their bodies against the metal and crystal cages but they don't budge even magic could not help thanks to the damestear, but that did not stop them, they kept running and lunging, blooding and mutilating their bodies but the guards did not budge. The Temples continue to radiate and activate.

Carefully leading the reconstruction efforts, using the spirits to distract or blame each other so the efforts progress with no issues or attract unwanted attention.\n\nOnce the restorations are finally done, each one of the Four Lords will be hosting a festival in one of the High Temples. Each is decorated in a specific way since each Great Spirit has a different form. A fiery shrine made to the Azure Dragon, elevating him to the same level as Yanhe with art and tributes that show power and authority. The Vermillion Bird, a shrine to elevate its grace and ambitions the same as Phokhao, precious gems and riches paint their shrine. The White tiger shall be elevated on the same level like Marutha with tributes of Might and wisdom inside his shrine. And the Black Tortoise shall mirror Telebei, filled with masterful art and craftsmanship. Artists, priests, and craftsmen from across the region called to ensure the proper dedication towards the spirits.\n\nA nation-wise celebration is called once all temples are prepared. All Great Spirits are called upon. Court mages and priests all do their respective rituals to summon each Great Spirit towards their respective temple, fireworks and illusion magic covering the sky.

Even the sky is shaking, the spiritual energies are cracking before the horizon flashes in blue hue, followed by a pillar of blue and yellow energies emitted from the temples, one by one the sky turns bright by the evening hour but only after a few more moments the arcane pillars start to change hue, the same colors as the wine that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is tasting, the sky soon follows as it turns a crimson hue as clouds gather towards [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s palace."

And while issues or disturbances have occurred before, this is something different...Read this report from a local girl for example: \n\n"Filthy Hobgoblin, not again!" My friends gave me a wary look as the ball ominously descended the dark and claustrophobic spiral staircase. This was not our first time losing the ball inside the temple, but each time was a nerve-wracking ordeal with the chilling darkness below. Despite the trepidation, we ventured into the foreboding High Temple to reclaim our lost ball. Deep within the dimly lit hall, we finally spotted the ball and hastily turned to leave. But this time, something felt terribly amiss. An unsettling feeling crept up my spine, but before I could ponder it further, I rushed to catch up with my friends, climbing the stairs frantically.\n\nJust as I was about to escape the last of the shadows, a sharp pain shot through my ankle. I spun around in horror, only to catch a fleeting glimpse of a malevolent grin retreating into the darkness. My heart pounded in my chest, and a primal fear overcame me. I let out a blood-curdling scream and sprinted up the stairs, not daring to look back. My breath was ragged as I raced straight home.\n\nWhen I arrived, panting and terrified, my mother brushed off my claims, dismissing them as childish imagination. My father scoffed, attributing the scratch to a stray animal. But my grandmother, her eyes hollow and distant, whispered with an eerie certainty, "They are coming, and our time is running out."

After centuries of captivity, the time for revenge has come, a moment to forever rid the sickly infection of the Left Hand Path and the Onis. Only then can Hokuma finally find solace.\n\nHokuma's appearance is that of a black mist, so deep and dark that no mage or artist has been able to replicate it. Within this mist lies Hokuma's strength, and above all, his rage—rage towards the Onis who have exploited him for ages, milking him for magic and power. But not only is he a spirit of anger, he is a spirit of the earth as well and cares deeply for its wellbeing.\n\nIn truth, Hokuma desires only one thing: tranquillity and peace in his hilly domain.

Residing in the Phokhao mountain range, far above both human and beast, Phokhao embodies splendour and grandeur, vanity and artistry, while simultaneously embodying generosity, nobility, and benevolence. These traits are not contradictory for Phokhao; instead, they enhance one another. Phokhao's demands and desires are unique, expensive, but above all, noble - something to take pride in.

At this point, a long nose is said to be a sign of his favor, taken to mean one has inherited their patriarch’s guile, from one of his many trunk-in-hand trysts with the lovely men and ladies of his domain. Though the truth or feasibility of this is debatable, brilliant advisors appear and vanish on a whim in the courts of Rahen, leaving trails of innovation and scandal in equal measure in their wake. While one can talk all they want of their wisdom and restraint... that sly grin will win out in the end.\n\nThe spectacle known as Dhenbasana doesn't cease with his actions. Emerging like a grand yet agile and athletic elephant, Dhenbasana is a charmer of prime allure. His arms and body adorned with the most exquisite jewellery, his trunk embellished with the finest tattoos, and his laughter, unadorned, stands as the world's most exquisite and irresistible. When Dhenbasana graces the court with his presence, a magnificent celebration and spectacle inevitably unfolds, sparing no expenses or efforts. Dhenbasana embodies intellect over strength, hedonism over piety, and even intrigues over sincerity and corruption over honour, because according to Dhenbasana, a sealed, candid, and uncomplicated life is simply tedious, boring and monotonous.\n\nDhenbasana's true desire from us is rather simple: a state that personifies hedonism. Away with the rigid and pious followers of High Philosophy, it's time for Rahen to bask in a golden era of pleasure! By gathering the greatest intellects, the most agile acrobats, the finest dwarf brewers, and the most sought-after courtesans, we can transform our court into a hub of delight, debauchery and Dhenbasanic pleasure!"

Only a princeling’s heart can say if they will return from the storm bearing a swirling crown of sand and dust, or if their pale, sand-scoured bones will lie beneath the desert forevermore.\n\nMarutha, a noble and regal beast, exudes a simplicity in its appearance, mirroring the inherent majesty of a lion, the paragon of regality itself. Its image adorns countless heraldries and banners, emanating royal power and honour unparalleled by any other creature. With a crown of golden hair and a stature befitting a monarch beyond compare, Marutha embodies the essence of nobility and royal grandeur. A ruler who aligns themselves with Marutha exudes unmatched potency, strength, and magnificence.\n\nA noble and splendid court is what Marutha deems as the hallmark of a court that is befitting of his approval. And so, this is the mission bestowed upon us by the mighty spirit lion. And our task is not only to prove to ourselves and Marutha the grandeur of our court, but to showcase it to the entire world!"

 spirits.839.t:0 "Gehet Ketine, Scorpionking of the Sands"
 spirits.839.d:0 "Lost in dreams, our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wandered through a fatally dry desert for weeks, with neither sustenance nor succour. As their dream-self began to finally collapse from thirst, they collapsed beneath a dry, shadeless tree, its branches clutching like gnarled hands towards the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s painfully slow death. From the stones before their eyes emerged a scorpion, a small creature with a bulbous tail swaying under its own weight. It crept across the broken earth, crawling onto the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s hand. There, it paused for a moment, staring with its many implacable eyes, stinger hanging over bare skin. Is this a sign? Is the scorpion a symbol and the desert an allegory of sorts? Waking up from the dream our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows it to be true: it is a message of the great spirit of the sands, the king of scorpions, dominion lord of the Naymak Kuwatai, Gehet Ketine.\n\nThe kingscorpion, Gehet Ketine shows itself as a larger than life desert scorpion but with some 'differences'. As while Gehet has a potent poison, their pincers aren’t smaller or less sharp because of this. Despite its imposing stature, the scorpion adeptly conceals itself within the shifting sands and dark shadows. Gehet Ketine embodies the essence of espionage, intrigue, and covert operations, its affinity for obscurity allowing it to embody the role of an assassin. With unparalleled finesse, Gehet operates from the concealment of darkness, its marks falling before they even notice, a testament to its mastery in the art of stealth.\n\nThe desert scorpion yearns for the arid expanse to reclaim its status as a haven for nomads and enigmatic assassins. No longer shall it tolerate the dominance of deceitful creeds or those who seek to malign and subjugate the spirits that dwell within. It is our sacred duty to fulfil this mission for Gehet Ketine. From the darkness of the shadows, we shall strike, swift as the desert tempests, and unrelenting as the scorpion's sting."

 spirits.840.t:0 "Hukai and Telebei, Rivertwins of the Bomdan"
 spirits.840.d:0 "United like twin rivers, yet separated by the land between them, the river siblings Hukai and Telebei form a symbiosis within Bomdan, bridging the north and south, the rivers that bear their names, and the cities that grace their shores. In their respective territories, these two spirits are viewed as auspicious omens. When a swan herder welcomes new cygnets, it is tradition to invoke the name of the darker Hukai as a tribute to the river. And when a turtle traverses a path along the Telebei, it is deemed an obligation for people to either allow the creature safe passage or aid it in crossing, safeguarding it from harm.\n\nThough dissimilar in appearance, the twin sisters are bound by an unbreakable connection. One is a magnificent black Halless swan, while the other is a steadfast freshwater turtle. This bond symbolises the deep unity among the peoples of these two rivers—forever intertwined in art, craftsmanship, and culture, much like the inseparable twins themselves.\n\nHukai and Telebei yearn for a resurgence of the arts and crafts within their domains. A time where craftsmanship and the arts reclaim their honourable positions, surpassing fleeting trends from distant lands. It rests upon us to reunite the swan and the turtle once more, nurturing the flourishing of the arts. While the glory of war may be transient, the essence of art endures eternally."
 spirits.840.a:0 "Grab my brushes and pencils, we are about to make something beautiful."
 spirits.841.t:0 "Huszien, The Vulpine Lady of Yìnquan"
 spirits.841.d:0 "Long ago, the Vulpine Lady of Yinquan, the queen of spirits, met her demise, not through murder, but through being fragmented into hundreds of fox spirits, a result of the machinations of the Precursors. As she passed, her devoted followers made a singular promise: that she would one day be reborn and subsequently return to her rightful place, and that day has arrived.Upon her resurrection, the Vulpine Lady will take the form of a fox with nine hundred and ninety-nine tails, symbolising the ambiguity between good and evil, the vast realm of moral greyness, and the allure of magic and the arcane. Just as her tails number a thousand, so do choices and interpretations of which none are true good or evil\n\nIf we want to succeed in resurrecting the Vulpine Lady, it will be paramount to ready ourselves for a new era, one where Huszien reigns over both spirits and humans. And so it falls upon us to make the necessary preparations for the resurrection ritual. Let the grand fox spirit rise from the realm of the departed and onto her rightful throne!"
 spirits.841.a:0 "She will rise from the grave and onto the worldstage."
 spirits.842.t:0 "Tughayasa: All-Seeing Eyes of the Oracle"
 spirits.842.d:0 "The all-seeing eye of Tughayasa stands as a unique spirit, distinct from all others. While some possess vast powers that rend the earth or ensnare the acts of debauchery, Tughayasa simply observes, seeing it all. This great Oracle spirit peers into the future and the past, casting its gaze upon lands both near and far. It perceives the seen and the unseen, culminating as the very essence that bestows its name and symbol upon the Oracle of Tughayasa.\n\nThis sublime Oracle spirit assumes the form of eyes, floating like paper talismans. When blinking it sounds like the shredding of paper and hovers above the world, ever-watchful and contemplative. It epitomises foresight, divination, and the profound philosophical insights and wisdom of the Oracle Order.\n\nTo garner its favour, we embark upon the sacred task of looking into the future, refining the Oracle of Tughayasa to greater heights and stature, and demonstrating to the spirit of unparalleled clarity our worthiness of its gift—the unbroken vision over all the entire expanse of Halann in past, present and future. Let us reveal our merit, inviting all to be seen through the discerning eyes of Tughayasa!"

 spirits.1000.t:0 "Yanhe's Offer"
 spirits.1000.d:0 "Ever since the awakening of the mighty Yanhe, the court of [Root.GetName] has been one of chaos. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] continued to stress over the many issues that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rise has caused, both across the land and within [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mind as well. [Root.GetName] had long claimed its legitimacy as the Mantle of the Yanhe; the mighty Dragon Army marched across the Yan river under the banner of its fearsome might, striking panic into their enemies. However, this has been brought into question by some of those opposed to us, with the onset of the Rending and the end of his slumber. How can we claim the mantle of Yanhe when Yanhe rampages in our land, bringing devastation in his wake? What legitimacy do we have to this title when its namesake is busy causing untold damage to our realm? What was once whispers had now become the dominant argument amongst the court of [Root.GetName], any semblance of decorum and peace long since gone.\n\nOne such argument had been ongoing for hours, [Root.Monarch.GetName] long since exasperated at the goings-on between [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] retinue, as the foundations seemingly shake, violent tremors rock the fortified basement room deep within the heart of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]’s Castle. The roof—no, the building itself—tears off its foundations, flung off to some far corner of the city, as the colossal form of Yanhe looks down upon the members of [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s court. His body is that of violent storms, huge in his stature. His massive body filled the sky of Bianfang with lightning, thunderous sound to match his thunderous rage. His being exuded raw, violent power.\n\n"To the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of [Root.GetName], [Root.Monarch.GetName], you claim the mantle of my domain. My name as your title, as you spread your influence along the length of my river. I find your claim to this mantle bold, yet I cannot help but be impressed with your recent achievements, if only somewhat. So I come to your court with an offer; pledge yourself to me and my service, tear down these abhorrent chains to my being, and you shall be rewarded in kind," orates the Great Spirit, voice booming down from the great Dragon’s maw. The response from the members of the court was immediate, a violent outcry from the more zealous faithful of High Philosophy's teachings, demanding an immediate and violent response. [Root.Monarch.GetName] ignored them, only speaking up to ask the spirit above [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], "And what if I decline?", voice more fearful than confident. "Then I will take my due," the only response. The outcry from the other members of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s retinue increased at this, voices congealing into a loud mass of debate and argument, although none reached [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s ears. All but deafened to the reality around [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was lost within the confines of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own mind. All that had been fought for, all that they held, could be lost and then some in this very moment. To abandon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] teachings, all [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had known for years would be the height of blasphemy, and the response would be far from measured and calm. But the alternative, the wrath of Yanhe himself, weighs heavy on the shoulders of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. At last, silencing the court, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] responds..."

 #Temple Quest Encounter descriptions TODO: Can rewrite or just fluff them up — up to a paragraph or two at max, basically describing a fight with golems or a trap encounter with associated outcomes of either coming out fine or getting 1 party member wounded/killed — could whip up a custom loca string to reference the party leader (the Storied Bard/Veteran Fighter etc) if desired. Every killed string should end with "a party member was §Rwounded§!/§Rkilled§!" or a variation of that, as a Necromancer might raise them, adding " Fortunately for them, they were §RRaised§! from death by the Necromancer." at the end of the description string
